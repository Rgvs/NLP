[title]:WOW! THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO MUSIC!
[fullText]:The RIO rocks! It is so great that Diamond Multimedia prevailed in their fight against the forces of pure evil in the music industry and allowed us, the public, to have the RIO! This little baby holds your MP3's and plays  them with outrageous quality and no moving parts! You simply cannot make  the music &quot;skip&quot;. Take it jogging, bob sledding, whatever! The  Rio is cute and compact, battery lasts forever, runs great and is really  simple to use. Works well with the PC linkup, etc. A hot item!

[title]:The first MP3 Handheld available on the Consumer market
[fullText]:I had high hopes for the Diamond Rio and it certainly lived up 2 the hype. Lightweight and excellent quality with some good connecting software. My only gripe can be with memory. You definately need another 32Mb to store  your music. If you want one, my advice is to wait for the new upgraded  version with 64Mb and a graphic equaliser!

[title]:Next Millenium Consumer Electronics
[fullText]:Diamond's RIO is the current, silicon-state nightmare for monopolistic entertainment industries. When the first audio recording-devices entered the consumer market decades ago, the idea of a controlled  &quot;charge-per-copy&quot; business model in the music industry was  doomed. Although traditional copyrights could never be totally enforced,  the record and music-producing industry neglected these threads existing in  the shades of multi-billion profits.<p>Mp3 and the Internet raided the  existing markets with their &quot;natural&quot; power like a cruise-missile  against a frying-pan.  Like other good examples for  &quot;Killer-Apps&quot;, the RIO is designed to Web-Specs (mp3). This makes  its use and performance comparable with other CD-quality playing devices  while putting the power of the internet into the palm of your hand. If you  want to make a statement of &quot;being digital&quot;, the RIO is a must!

[title]:Brilliant!
[fullText]:Remember when the Walkman hit the market years ago?  At first it was fad, then it became a craze before finally becoming as ubiquitous as taxi cabs in Manhattan.  The Diamond Rio is the first product with the potential to  eventually REPLACE the Walkman.  Think about it - portable music that  sounds as clear as a compact disc from a device that looks and feels like a  pager.  Unshockable, no matter how much you jump around or how bumpy the  bus ride.  This is the perfect gift for your favorite &quot;gadget  junkie&quot;, as long as they have a PC to download from.  Pssst...here's a  secret:  you can record your own CD's into MP3 format and download the  songs into your RIO - it isn't just for internet music!!  Great product.

[title]:Do your self a favor and get a portable mini disc player.
[fullText]:Only a half an hour of &quot;near&quot; quality music makes this format seriously flawed. To change music you eventually have to upload new music, i.e. a huge inconveneince when a computer is available. Mini disc is also  shock proof, recordable, near cd quality but in addition you can change  music with out the inconvenience of uploading music from a computer.

[title]:This is righteous stuff!
[fullText]:I bought this for one reason, and one reason only: size. Many of the other mp3 players out there were larger and clunkier. I own a Handspring Visor Deluxe and was going to use that as an mp3 player because of the aforementioned clunky sizes of other players. &quot;Why spend money for something that's not much smaller?&quot; I thought. Then, I stumbled across this baby... I read the specs and was admittedly not too impressed. 32 megs is not much, especially if you're going for full stereophonic 128 kbps sound. At that rate you could only get about half an hour of music - enough to go to the store, but not much more. Of course, there was always the option of a memory card but those added to the cost. It looked like I was going to pass this player by until I saw one on sale at an un-named competitor of this fine site. At the price I saw it for, I had to take the chance... Twenty four hours later, I'm still in awe. To begin with, just seeing the darn thing gives you a swell feeling. It's tiny, I mean tiny. It made my wife proclaim it to be &quot;cute.&quot; In such a small package I was expecting so-so sound at best. Not true. It is super duper. The built-in equalizer is servicable enough, and it takes a quick press o' the button to change settings. So I was hooked on the sound and size, there was only the capacity issue to consider... Then I rememberd my good friend db PowerAmp Music Converter (search for it on the web). This sweet program lets you convert current mp3's to lame or blade mp3's with a smaller bit rate. Smaller bit rate means smaller size. Smaller size means less space on the 32 meg memory, which translates into more sound. Lovely. Some will decry encoding anything to less than cd (128 kbps) sound, but pah I say. I was born and raised on analog and a little less crispness in my music is actually preferred. The human ear can barely discern the difference between 80 and 128 kbps recordings anyway, so why bother? At 80 kbps I can squeeze about 50 minutes or so of music into that 32 megs. Not bad. Not bad at all. After I buy a 64 or 96 meg card, I'll be waltzing back and forth to work with only my tiny kazoo as my companion. Beautiful. If you are reading this and thinking either &quot;What in hades is he talking about?&quot; or &quot;That is way to much bother for listening to some music!&quot; please reconsider! It takes only a few minutes (even for you 56 k types) to download db PowerAmp and a few more to convert the mp3's to lower bitrates. Trouble? Nah. At least not for the payoff. Sweet music for a sweet price. Did I mention it's tiny and cute? Buy this mp3 player and be a happy camper. It's a wonder.

[title]:Not Universal
[fullText]:Beware when considering this product!  Although it prominently displays the USB compatability, it does not state on the exterior package that it is only Window compatible.  When I found a friend foolish enough to be using Window's software I got some music loaded into it.  It is a remarkable device, small, easy to use, good sound quality, and expandable.  However, after about 1 month of use the screen died and it is currently in route to RCA for a repair/replace.  I complained to them that the word Universal in USB should mean Universal, i.e. both Mac and Windows compatible.

[title]:The smallest MP3 player; very well designed.
[fullText]:After about a week of researching about 25 mp3 players I finally settled on the RCA Kazoo. I wanted the smallest mp3 player possible, but didnt want to sacrifice great sound. My Kazoo delivers for only $... After much research I decided I needed a unit that had: lock (so buttons dont get pushed accidentally), bass boost/ equalizer, digital volume control, big clear display, & fast transfer rate (2.4Mb/sec). You'd be supprised many more expensive units dont have all of these features. I also didnt care about other formats since mp3 is the standard & all formats can be converted to mp3 via software. The included software Music Match & Real Jukebox are excellent. I just dragged & dropped my mp3 files from explorer into real Jukebox. Real Jukebox lets you set the bit rate you would like and automatically lowers bitrate on files to bitrate you choose to save memory/size. This brigs me to the 1 of 2 drawbacks. ALthough 32 mb is common w/ mp3 players it isnt enough (at 128k bit rate). I plan on ordering a 64 MB MM card (dont pay more than $1/mb if you decide to buy memory). I did find out that at 56k the sound was still awesome & I can hold about 75 minutes of music w/o extra memory. The second drawback doesnt apply to me but I read in one review that this doesnt support Mac. If you are a windows user you will be very satisfied!! I can't see why anyone could buy a player w/ a slower transfer rate; USB is the way to go. <br>One last note: The display is large & easy to read. It shows track, time, bit rate, volume, battery, & dsp.  It does not show the name of the current song that is playing the way larger mp3 players do.<br>Hope this helps & good luck in your search.

[title]:RCA K@ZOO
[fullText]:This mp3 player is awesome. It's go great sound and is so small. It's lightweight and portable. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because it doesn't have that much memory. I can fit up to 10 songs on it. If it had more memory I would give it a five star. But great for beginners who want a mp3 player because it's so inexpensive and it's easy to use.

[title]:DO NOT DEAL WITH RCA/THOMPSON!
[fullText]:I bought this player and was fairly happy with it.  It is very small and sounds fine.  Unfortuneately, I lost the cd containing the drivers for it.  I called customer service to get a replacement cd.  My first call to RCA/Thompson technical support directed me to a page where I could download software for the RCA Lyra.  After telling the representative that I had the K@zoo, and not the Lyra, he said &quot;sorry, that's all the information I have.&quot;  <p>Today, I figured I'd try again - maybe there'd be more information.  This time I was told, in fact, that the software is not available online, but that the cd could be shipped to me.  However, it would cost $12.95 for a cd containing one driver, and 2 free to download software programs.  I was about to order, when I was then informed of the $9.95 SHIPPING FEE.  TO MAIL ME ONE COMPACT DISK.  <p>Needless to say, I am far from pleased, and I urge anyone considering buying an RCA product to stay far, far away.  If you ever need customer service (and judging by the reviews of many mp3 players, you will), you will greatly regret the purchase.

[title]:Great Product!
[fullText]:I bought this today and I'm very pleased.  The size is great (very small), the sound quality is excellent, and the behind-the-ear headphones that it came packaged with are also very nice.  The price is very low and the USB feature makes transfer easy.  The software included is relatively simple to use and allows you to insert cds, and create MP3 files.  <br>The only drawback is that the 3 ways they made for you to wear it are pretty bad.  It comes with a pendant (who wants to have it swinging around their neck?) a little plastic pouch that is very hard to put on your belt, and a wrist strap.  I found a good way to wear it, though.  Buy one of those little sticky things with the belt clip that you use for a cell phone and then just clip it on your belt with that.  Once you get that, it's perfect.

[title]:DOESN'T WORK ON MY WINDOWS XP MACHINE
[fullText]:Even thought I got this thing FREE after rebates with the purchase of Windows XP, even though the Install disk says Windows XP, Windows XP tells you when you try to install it that it is NOT CERTIFIED to run on Windows XP.  I figured it must run OK nonetheless, since the Install disk says XP and it came free with Windows XP, but it doesn't on my machine.<p>In fact, even though the player shows up when you plug it in on the taskbar, the software doesn't recognize it.  Windows Media Player doesn't see it either.  <p>The USB cable is too short if you have a tower machine.  It doesn't even reach to the counter.

[title]:Nice size but need more memory
[fullText]:While this unit best feature is it's small light weight size, without a memory card you can only get 6-8 MP3's on the built in 32 meg of flash ram. Also I've heard that the software won't work with Windows XP, I had planed on upgrading soon? The headphones are pretty good although they start to hurt the ears after 30-40 mins. This MP3 player sure blows away those old clunky walkman CD players, it's 1/10th of the size and weight! Smaller is indeed better!

[title]:Elegant Package,  Easy To Operate, Surprising FM Tuner
[fullText]:This MP3 player, voice recorder, FM radio all-in-one is 1/4" longer and same width as my AMEX card and 1/4" thick. Five buttons on two edges control all functions while 1" X 5/8" see-through display gives needed info. Diplay was B in normal room light with my trifocal glasses and was C- with adjustable edge lighting in dark rooms. The built-in battery recharges from any USB connection. You will want a short USB connector, not the six-footer that is included - compactness is why you buy it.<br /><br />Windows 2000 and XP recognize the player at once when connecting with the USB cable. The player comes up as an external drive, so just move files with Explorer and you are set.<br /><br />Voce recorder is easy enough and did an adequate job recording me from my shirt pocket with decent fidelity. Probably OK on a desktop to pick up two or three people around the desk. Built-in mic is the only choice.<br /><br />FM tuner sensitivity was a nice surprise. Reception in my office was as clear and sensitive as on my Grundhig portable, and it automatically scanned in 30 stations on first use. (Presets can of course be manually chosen.) The earbuds are the antenna.<br /><br />A crummy cloth bag was included, but a small leather slip case with a pocket clip would have been so easy to do and much more useful.<br /><br />Sound with the included earbuds seemed fine to me - definitely a a few steps above entry level.The unit is nicely packaged and looks like it could be dropped a good number of times with no problems.

[title]:Pretty sweet
[fullText]:Ok, first of all, in response to a few of you who have 'reviewed' the Zen Micro already:  If there aren't many OGG players out there, there's probably a good reason for it. For some reason, 'Betamax' keeps ringing in my ears...  Second, no one, and I mean NO ONE, listens to AM radio. Unless you want to catch 'the game', or perhaps you're just grumpy because your cane has fallen behind the washing machine again and you can't reach it?  Third, if your girlfriend laughs at you, tell her where to shove it. Strap on a pair man. If anything you should feel smug for owning a quality piece of intriguing equipment.  As an iPod owner, I can say well done to creative for emulating apple's simplicity and sleek looks. I'd be interested.

[title]:Get a Rio Karma instead
[fullText]:This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.  The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.  The karma is only $5 more, it's small, had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg.  The karma doesn't look as sexy but it's interface is very efficiently designed.  In fact, it's much better than the iPod in that regard.  The karma also has a very long battery life.  Having owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better.  No comparison in my opinion.

[title]:Not really a review.
[fullText]:This is not really a review since the product isn't even available yet.  I'd just like to point out to the all the ipod lovers out there that this device completely rules the ipod when it comes to the battery.  If the ipod's battery stops taking a charge, which usually happens after about 18 months of steady use, you CAN'T replace it yourself.  You have to send it back to the factory where they charge you ninety-nine bucks plus shipping.  For that simple reason I will never own an ipod.

[title]:The Preview
[fullText]:Alot of people seem to compare any music player to an Ipod. Comments such as "it's stylish" or "it looks cool" or "everyone has it" don't nesseseraly make something good.About the Ipod: it has it's downfalls as well. As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front. Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to "unhold" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player. After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself). Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this. $190 or $200 or less would have been much more reasonable (price compareble to 20gb mp3 players). As for the warrenty, i havent seen it yet, but i fear for a short one again.  Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too. They are bold colors, not the (personally) irratating toned down 'light' Ipod colors. It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).  The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).    Verdict:  Had I not needed something with a tad bit more space, I consider this player fair game. If you don't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive, I'd recomment buying it to try out, and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it (there are some offered here, for about $15 dollors I think).  Closing: For everyone who is shallow and buys the Ipod only becouse of it's looks (i'm not saying it's necissarily bad), here's a joke: What did the Pencil Sharpener say to the Pencil? Stopping going in circles and get to the point. Why go in circles to find something you want? (  :)  )

[title]:Should be good
[fullText]:Nobody has clearly articulated what exactly about the Ipod mini makes it better than this product.  I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like "Just go buy an Ipod!"  Apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.  It is unlikely that you will EVER get the best products just by sticking with one company.  What is the conjunctive probability that each successive product release will be without flaws or that the company isn't having turnover in the R&D department (or making bad management decisions)?  Apple never was involved with a lot of audio products until the Ipod.  I have owned some kind of Creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support.  Of course, some were better than others, and I probably could have gotten a better sound card from another company at some point.  The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.  It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.  Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.  It may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties.

[title]:The first legitimate iPod mini killer
[fullText]:Creatives new Zen micro is a promising mp3 player for people of all ages. It seems to be the only mini-drive player that can compete with the iPod mini. Compared to the mini, heres are the pros and cons:   Pros-Removable battery, Better battery life, Ten electrifying colors(5 more than the mini), Intuitive vertical Touch Pad, Mesmerizing blue glow, FM radio with recording, Voice recording and built in mic, Twice the internet music access(including Napster, MSN's music service and more), Comes with everything you need (A belt clip that doubles as a stand, a protective carrying case, a USB 2.0 cable, a universal AC adapter and in-ear dynamic bass response earbuds)  Cons-Even though it hold more songs than the iPod mini,5gb may not be enough storage for a growing music library, Does not have games which should not be an issue for most people, Not as many accessory options from brands other than Creative (but hey, it comes with everything you'll ever need, except the optional wired remote which i will be getting once i get mine)  All in all, this is a solid player for many users from the begginer to the audiophile  yes..i will be getting one, the Pros substantially outnumber the cons. This is the player ive been looking for.

[fullText]:I'm a fanatic...I normallly do alot of research before buying anything...I looked at the Creative Zen, mini-IPOD etc. Then I came across this beauty by chance on Amazon, released at the start of April. It is incredible..very light and tiny, beautiful clear screen, user-friendly software, great sound. The earphones included are terrible but thats pretty normal for this sort of purchase. Everyday use is childs-play, uploading songs is quick and easy. Controls are perfect too and well-designed.  I took a chance and bought this without any real knowledge of its reliability..so far so good..dropped it already and no problems. Also comes with a handy case.   Most of my friends have mini IPODs...I was tempted to join the masses...but everyone agrees this jukebox is superior...and its far nicer to look at..the aluminium finish is superb, though it does get smudged easily. I am a very proud owner so far. Added addition is ability to look at photos.  Be brave and buy this...you will not be disappointed!!!

[title]:How RCA Lyra works with Napster To Go
[fullText]:How to make RCA Lyra RD2765 be recognized as MTP player and installed as Napster To Go device.  There are 2 settings you should check:  1) Be sure that your Protocol is set to MTP (Microsoft Transport Protocol) to insure that your device will work with N2G.   2) The correct MTP driver must be installed by Windows XP. If not, it will only be recognized as a USB Mass Storage device.  There are 2 protocols in this device: MTP & MSC.  You can switch between MTP & MSC if you are a Windows XP user. Unfortunately, old Windows O/S users like Win98 cannot make this switch. It will be fixed to MSC.  How to switch from MTP to MSC and vice versa.  1. From the settings menu, rotate the Control ring to select Advanced.  2. Push the Control Joystick to the right to view Advanced options.  3. The current protocol will be displayed.  4. Press the Control Joystick to switch be tween MTP and MSC.  5. Push the Control Joystick to the left to return to the previous submenu, or press the M button to exit the menu.    More information on MTP & MSC:  Why do I want to use MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) Mode?  MTP Mode is essential if you want to transfer DRM content to your Lyra Jukebox. Today MTP Mode is only supported in Windows XP and through Windows Media Player 10.0 or other special software provided by your music service provider. In MTP mode you Lyra Jukebox will no longer show up as a drive letter. So programs that were designed to work with a device that shows up as a drive letter will not be able to work directly with the Lyra Jukebox.  Why do I want to use MSC (Mass Storage Class) Mode?  If you are using Windows 98SE, ME or 2000 you can not use MTP Mode only MSC Mode is available. Your Lyra Jukebox will always show up as a MSC device.  If you are using Windows XP your Lyra Jukebox will show up as a MTP device, but we have provide you the option to be able to switch it to MSC Mode with a setting in the Advanced Options section of the Lyra Jukebox. Once this setting is set to MSC Mode every time you connect the device to the PC it will show up as a drive letter and allow you to use any software that can work with MSC Mode. This will also allow the current version of LyraDJ or any other playlist editing program to find the device.  All supported content put on the device in either mode MTP or MSC will be available to play on the device once it is disconnected from the PC. So you could add mp3 files in the  MSC Mode then run LyraDJ, Profile the device and disconnect it. Then switch it to MTP Mode and reconnect it and add DRM content to it.

[title]:it...
[fullText]:personally i think that this thing is a great mp3 player if you intend to only have it for a few months, i've had mine for 3 months today, and so far the only thing that i've found is that is, wheel used for ajusting the volume sucks! and then eventually the little joystick will stop working and it is very hard to keep clean. It is currently in the process of being sent to the manufacturer so that i can be fully refunded my money.

[title]:I'm not impressed
[fullText]:My unit is actually the red one that is 4 GB but otherwise the same. I'm not impressed at all. Within TWO DAYS of gentle treatment the screen had a line through it. I didn't like the musicmatch software or synching with Windows Media Player. I DO like the hard drive factor  and once I changed it from MTP to MSC it worked better. I thought it was a good price for a 4 GB model, but I'm not sure I'm even going to keep it now. It is small and cute, but not very sturdy. I also can't find a case to fit it appropriately and still allow access to the controls. All the cases seem to be made for iPods.

[title]:This thing is worhtless
[fullText]:I bought this because Consumer Reports gave it a high rating.  I should have read the reviews here first.  It won't even connect with our computer using a USB port I use all the time and we've tried 3 cords, 2 of which are verified.  The device just says 'connecting' and windows says the device is malfunctioning.  I hope we can get our money back since we ordered it through an Amazon affiliate.  We've tried some of the settings suggestions posted here to no avail.  I would give it a negative star if that was an option.  Maybe it's just this one that is a lemon.  But this is a real disappointment as it was a gift for my husband and I spent a lot of time researching this purchase.  Paint me a sucker.

[title]:Terrible service
[fullText]:I am still waiting to receive my player from having it shipped off more than 1 month ago.  Got the player for Christmas, got it up and running with no problem.  Putting required software on my computer was a breeze.  I really like the sleek, shiny look of the player and it had good organization of files, etc.  Anyway, after about 2 days, got a message when I turned it on that "File system was corrupted."  Player was still under warranty, so I shipped it off to their processing HQ in TX.  They received my package (as shown by UPS) 4 weeks ago.  Called once, after 2 weeks, and they said it had not been logged into the system, but would get it taken care of.  Now, today it is still not logged into their system and I can call back in 24-48 hrs to check my status.  Calling in takes every bit of fifteen minutes of listening to horrendous Pan-flute music looped over and over again.  I think this would be a nice player, but customer service is sorely lacking.  I will write a real review of this player... if I ever get it back.

I will never buy one of their products again and I'm doing my best to inform everyone out there that they'll be tossing their money in the trash by purchasing any iRiver products. My system cost me $340.00 and it is now as useless as the customer service department at iRiver

[title]:Great Media Player for the Price
[fullText]:I purchased the PMC-120 in July 2007. It's very easy to use and there was plenty of storage space for me to store the material I wanted. There are over 2100 songs and 30 videos on my player with 8GB of space remaining. I was able to purchase it for a hundred bucks, so that made it that much more enjoyable. I would give the PMC-120 a five star rating, but it is to dependent on Windows Media 10. Maybe I-River can come up with a format that allows the PMC-120 to be able to sychronize with Windows Media 11 or higher? The video quality is excellent, and it is user friendly. Their tech support is decent, but they try to help you through any problems that may occur with the PMC-120. When you get your device there will be around 18GB on it. I'm thinking of getting the nieces and nephews one for Christmas or birthdays. It's a little bulky, but I'm pleased with the purchase. It normally sells for over $500.00, so you should hurry up and land one. If you want to waste your money, purchase an IPOD. Whenever I take a road trip I hook up the PMC-120 to the I-River FM Transmitter, and it's music non stop. The PMC-120 has a car charger, but it doesn't come with it. I bought my charger for $12.00 off of E-Bay.

[fullText]:I purchased the iRiver PMC120 on 12/12/07 and gave it to my grandson as an early Christmas gift on 12/21/07.  On 12/23/07, the screen quit working and the inner screen has the appearance of being broken; however, there is no damage to the outer screen or any other part of the PMC and no reason to suspect that the PMC was abused.  I have returned it to iRiver, as instructed, and am awaiting their response.  Needless to say, I am not impressed with the product at this time and have not yet formed an opinion about iRiver's service since they were closed when the situation occurred, I was only able to initiate proceedings after January 2, 2008 and the issue is currently unresolved.

[title]:Creative Labs does not offer customer support
[fullText]:Purchased this MP3 player in April 2005.  Worked great for twelve months - then I had a problem - it was stuck in FM mode, and I could not turn it off (unless I pulled out the batteries each time).  Went to the Creative Labs web site for support - nothing there to help my situation - then I sent an email - and they told me that they WOULD NOT ASSIST ME, and then refered me back to the web site.  They also gave me a phone number to call - but that IT WOULD COST ME [...] EVERY 30 MINUTES OF "SUPPORT" THAT THEY PROVIDE!!!!   So now my MP3 player is no longer functional, and I need to buy a new one.  If you value customer service - STAY AWAY FROM CREATIVE LAB PRODUCTS

[title]:Great Mp3 Player
[fullText]:I had this Mp3 player for 1-2 years before I got my Ipod Nano. I never found anything wrong with it, and for the price I still think it is more worth the value than an ipod. I always reccomend the Creative over the ipod to friends on a limited budget. Here are a few pros and cons that I have noticed.  Pros:  1. This thing is TINY. Easily fits in your pocket, but just big enough to feel it (so you know its still there).  2. Very durable (Especially with the case).  3. Good Sound, never had a problem with scratchy noises or anything.  4. Voice recording is really cool, saves as a WAV file that you can upload on your computer.  5. FM/AM radio has very good reception.  6. The software that comes with it is awesome. Click and drag ripping similar to itunes, but better in that you can convert WAV and other audio formats into Mp3s (Very helpful).  7. Great battery life (better than my iPod's)   Cons: 1. Small screen (but this isn't really a problem considering how small the whole thing is).  2. No playlists, you have to scroll through every single song to find the one you want. I found this a little tedious, but it wasn't that bad because you can go through each song in like 1/2 a second (although that is a problem when you have a couple hundred songs).   Those are the only two cons that I can think of. Oh, and my headphones were magnetic for some reason, I don't know if anyone else's are like that, but thats kindof cool. Overall, I think the pros definetly outweigh the cons, and I would say for the great price, its one of the best out there.

[title]:Cheap, highly functional MP3 player.
[fullText]:The FM receiver is extremely insensitive.  You practically have to climb the transmitter mast and skewer the thing on the antenna in order to get it to receive a decent signal.  Other than that, it's great.  Battery life is about 2 weeks or so playing MP3s at reasonable volume for 4 hours a day.  Sound quality is better than expected for something packaged in a tiny block of molded plastic.  You will probably want better headphones than the ones that come with it, but the included ones are good for working out with, since you really won't care if you get them sweaty.  Of course, it would be better with more storage.  It is extremely lightweight.  Having owned a number of personal stereo type devices over the years, this is the only one that I consistently use.  The reason is that the size and weight make it convenient to be wired for sound nearly anywhere at any time.  I can easily stick it in any pocket while wearing the earphones, and forget that it is there.  (Aside from the fact that it is playing music in my ears.)

[title]:I liked it until it died
[fullText]:I really liked this MP3 player when I first got it, except for the color. It was darker in person that it showed on the computer. Besides that, the MP3 player worked great. It was my first one I had gotten and it was easy enough to use since I mostly used it for workouts and just let it play in order. The first problem I had early on was that it would get stuck after 1 certain song I had on it. At first I thought it was just the song because I would power it off then power on and it would work fine on the next song. I probably had it about a year to a year and a half before one day it just stopped working. At first I thought it was the battery because it kept powering off, but when I put new batteries in it, it wouldn't turn on.   It might have been that it could have been easily fixed, but I just would rather go buy a new one instead of dealing with the hassle of fixing it for the price it cost.

[title]:Just Amazing
[fullText]:I got the Muvo N200 for Christmas. I previously had a Samsung Yp-35, and was more than satisfied with it. However, this blows the Yepp out of the water. Here's a list of some of the pros and cons I have found with the player.  PROS 1. The volume range is great. I have never had to turn it all the way up, so you wont have a problem with it being too quiet like some other players. 2. The folder starage is great. Instead of scolling throught a couple hundred songs, I can just go through a dozen or so folders. 3. Great size. The thing is tiny 4. The button interface on it is very well laid out. I can use it in my pocket, without haveing to worry about hitting the wrong thing. 5. The recorder and microphone are great. I particularly liked that you could change the bit rate right on the player. (bit rate: higher bit rate= better quality, but larger file, and vice-versa.) 6. The line in ias a great feature. 7. Really easy to use. Just copy and paste your files. 8. Completely customizable equalizer. 9. Great options for the player's diplay. Reversible screen, contrast, etc.  CONS 1. Like some other people commented, there is a buzz in the background when the light is on. However, you only barely notice if the volume is at lower than 23 or so. (the volume goes up to 40) 2. The ear phones, while they do sound pretty good, are HUGE. They definetly are not the most comfortable things in the world, but they soung pretty good, and you can always replace them.  Overall, I think that this is definetly an awsome buy. Personally, I don't think i will ever regret it. However, I've only had it for one day, so I'll change my review if anything comes up in the future. But as of rightnow, it is great.

[title]:The BEST MP3 Player Money Can Buy Right Now
[fullText]:I received this MP3 player for Xmas, after doing a TON of research, and this product is sublime.  I got mine for a mere $119 on amazon, new, and the shipping was free.  The sound quality is excellent, thought what people are saying about the white earbuds is true (can hurt after awhile.)  But once you get over that initial pain in your ear, the pain definitely goes away as you will be listening to sweet tunes.  The sound quality is definitely exceptional.  To use the line in feature, all you need is a stereo with a CD player, pop the CD in, press record on the MP3 (with the included cable attached), and you can go take a shower or do whatever you need to do, and the MP3 player will AUTOMATICALLY space each track for you!  So you don't need to sit there and press record for each track.  And I agree with the others, that the FM radio is top-notch.  Stations come in nice and crisp, and it even has a preset feature.  As far as the design, it is FLAWless.  NO SKIPPING.  Ever.  Impressively, it is very very tiny, mine is orange, you can adjust the LCD screen for a lefty or a righty, and the solid color selection is the frosting.  This little bugger is an intuitive DREAM because eventually, you can slip it into your pocket, and you can adjust volume, change folders/tracks or swith playing modes while it's STILL in your pocket!  It's THAT easy to use.  Very intuitive and you will catch on quickly.  It also scrolls the song titles and artists, which I appreciate very much.  The USB 2.0 cable that comes with it delivers seriously lightning fast transfers.   And as far as flash space, I can easily hold 10-15 albums on it.  I know that you can record from the FM radio, but I have yet to figure that out.  The only minuses are: I would trade it for a 1 GB version in a second.  And when the LCD screen is on, there is a very slight buzzing, though you can only hear it if you are in bed about to go to sleep, and even then, it goes away after 2 seconds and it doesn't bother me one bit.  I have to say that if you buy this product, you will NOT be sorry.  I carry it with me constantly and use it constantly.  So far this player only received excellent reviews, so you should get one.  It is the cheapest and the best.  And even if you don't consider the price, it is STILL the best flash MP3 player ever.

[title]:Small, but ineffective.  Size does NOT matter.
[fullText]:Although I love the size and plug-and-play simplicity of this player, I can't stand the way it works.  A perky customer support person at Creative told me that it was not designed to support "playlists."  What that means is that you cannot control the order in which songs are played.  So, if you are making a workout mix, you can't put the fast songs first and then cool down songs.  You can't listen to albums in their entirety or intended order.  You can't control anything about the playback experience.  So if you don't mind having Hayden and Hendrix mixed together, this is the player for you.  But if you want to experience music how the artists intended to be experienced, or how you intended when you made the mix, then steer clear of this one.  You will either be disappointed, or very frustrated as you change all the song names in your music library to "a" "b" "c" so that it will play as you want it to.  Bummer.

[title]:More like 4 and a half stars
[fullText]:This isn't the perfect Mp3 player, but it's pretty good, especially when you consider the price. Overall, this player has more good features than it does bad.  It also has a number of features I doubt I'll ever use.  The Good: - Size - at 512 meg, it's not meant to hold your entire CD library.  It's a great player to take jogging.  It holds roughly seven or eight full albums. (maybe more depending on the quality of the mp3s) - File transfer - it's a flash storage device.  So to get songs onto your mp3 player simply drag and drop the files from your computer. - Size/weight - the thing is less than an ounce.  (Try holding two AAA batteries, that's how much it weighs with its battery).  It's about the size of a lighter.  - Strap and holder - comes with it's own velcro strap and rubbery holder. I-pod charges another 20 bucks for theirs. This player comes with a strap free. Free!! - Battery - while on the Ipod subject, this player uses one AAA battery.  I'm not sure how long it lasts, because mine still has juice, so at least several hours on one battery.  So, unlike the Ipod that has an internal battery and costs oodles of cash to replace, this comes with a AAA battery that's cheap and easy to replace (and it only needs replacing on rare occasions). - Sound Quality - uhhh...it's good and stuff - Price - Quite a lot of bang for the buck.  I've seen players with half the storage sell for the same price. Again: this player will not hold your entire mp3 library, if that's what you want, this player's not for you. - System compatability - some mp3 players (Ipod again), only work on Windows XP or 2000.  This one will work with Windows '98.   The Bad - Rubber USB port cover - it's flimsy and I just know it's going to fall off.  I don't think that'll affect the player, but I'd rather have a cover that worked and didn't fall apart. - backlight noise - with low volume (25/40), there's a perceptible buzzing noise whenever the backlight is on.  Of course, you can turn the backlight off, and it's completely unnoticable when the volume is turned up (mine' usually at 30 or so when jogging). - Track playing problems - a couple of tracks skip on this player, and other times whole albums would not play unless I transferred each individual track (instead of just dragging the entire album file).  - Ear buds - these furry things annoy me. They're okay for sound quality, but they're a bit uncomfortable. Ipod's are much better. I already had earphones for my old mp3 player, and I use them instead of the ones that came with this one.  Stuff I probably won't ever use - FM Radio - if I wanted an FM radio, I wouldn't have blown $120 bucks on an mp3 player! - file management software - even though you don't need it (see file transfer above), the player comes with its own mp3 management software.  Actually, I've used this some, and it's better than some (Rio, musicmatch); but it's still pretty useless. - microphone - The quality is OK, but why would anyone ever want to record their own voice into an mp3 player? Maybe I'm just narrowminded... - Mp3 ripper - this player comes with its own line that you can connect to a CD player to rip mp3's directly onto your player. If you're looking at mp3 players, odds are, most of your CDs are already ripped.  I have to say, overall I'm pleased with my purchase.  It's not perfect, but at the price it performs very well and avoids a lot of the pitfalls of other mp3 players. No it's not a 40 gig player that stores ALL your songs you ever heard.  It is a good value, and the perfect player to take to the gym.  ****UPDATE**** After 5 months, this product stopped working properly.  It skipped tracks, and played some but not others.  Customer support was a complete joke.

[title]:Great for audio books
[fullText]:I was looking for a flash mp3 player that would work well for audio books.  I had briefly thought of buying the new Apple Shuffle, but realized that it really wouldn't suit my purposes well (who'd want to accidentally hit the "Shuffle" button in the middle of War and Peace?).    This one is excellent.  I signed up for Audible, and downloaded a couple of books.  The cool thing is that if you start to listen to one track, and then flip to a different one, it remembers where you were on the first track -- very cool.  I was able to listen to my Wodehouse book, and pass it on to my bored 8-old to listen to an interview with Lemony Snicket, then flip back and pick up my book right where I was.  It's very small, and the nice holster clips easily onto my jeans pocket.  With 512MB, it has plenty of space -- I've already put about 9 hours worth of material on it, and barely made a dent in the available space.  The only complaint I have is that while it has a place to slip on a lanyard, it does not come with one.  A fairly minor complaint.  All in all -- a great player.

[title]:Fantastic - if you're a geek
[fullText]:My wife has an iPod which she takes with her everywhere.  I used it several times, and I liked it for what it was: a dedicated mp3 player.  However, when the time came for me to get one, I decided to go with the iRiver H340.  I bought it about 1 week ago, and have been tinkering with and using it from morning to night ever since.  Here's my take on it.  Warning:  If you buy an iRiver H340, prepare to don your geek beanie.  Here's why:  1.  Button commands need to be memorized.  It took me all of 20-30 mins to go through the manual and figure things out.  There's a directional pad and 5 buttons, but the buttons have multiple functions depending upon whether you push them quickly, hold them down for a while, where in the menu tree you are, etc.  I personally found the learning curve relatively easy, but this is no iPod (which practically anyone can use right out of the box).  As for me, a 20-30 minute up front time investment is no big deal, and I like having the extra controls (e.g., almost 10 different shuffle and repeat commands).  2.  The user interface is NOT elegant (for elegance, see "iPod").  There's a bit of a half-finished, work-in-progress feel to the H340.  For instance, you can't view pictures while listening to music.  It's strictly either-or.  The music search function is in no way as easy to use as iPod's, either.  There's a default file tree, which is essentially Windows explorer function.  You literally search through folders and filenames (e.g., "beethovens5th.mp3") to get to songs.  I still haven't been able to get the artist/album/genre/song search functions to work, so I can't comment.  3.  Weight/size.  The H340 is about the same length and width as an iPod, but it's perhaps twice as thick and somewhat heavier too.  Not that we got the bad stuff out of the way, and scared off the iPodders, let's get to the stuff I like.  1.  Fantastic array of functions.  The voice recorder uses the external mic built into the H340 to give you stunning recordings.  There's more recording options and settings than you can shake a stick it (although I have seen some reviewers rue the lack of some advanced functions - but it's not like I'd know what they were in the first place).  The Photo Viewer is crude but handy.  There are some file size restrictions you have to observe.  Also, unless the pictures fall into a narrow range of dimensions, the picture will not fill up more than 50-60% off the LCD screen.  It almost makes you wish for a zoom function.  Still, I like it just fine (again, not iPod level, but good enough).  And the LCD screen is gorgeous, with high resolution, contrast and brightness.  It's perfectly readable in daylight.  The Text Viewer is nice, but is limited only to .txt files.  I don't plan on using it a lot, but it's nice to have.  I'm sure iRiver will come out with additional functions in future firmware releases.  The Browser function allows you to use the H340 as a storage drive.    2.  Plug 'n Play.  You just plug'n'play this puppy into any computer.  No CDs or drivers to mess with.  It goes right into the USB port of any computer and Windows will automatically recognize it.  BIG PLUS in my book.  And loading music into the unit is as simple as copying and pasting or dragging 'n dropping files from the computer right into the unit.  The H340 just appears as another drive on your desktop, folks.  This was critical to me, because I plan to use the H340 as much more than a mere mp3 player; i.e., I'm a lawyer, so I will be using this to record witness oral statements, take digital pictures and plug my Nikon camera right into the H340 to download the pics and view them (USB on the go rules!).  Note, you have to install and use 3d party software in order to extract music files from the iPod.  3.  Great hardware.  Fantastic sound (beats the iPod by a MILE, came with Sennheiser earbuds too!).  The LCD screen is gorgeous, as I mentioned above.  The hard drive storage is more than most people will ever need, whether 20 or 40 gigabytes.  The hard drive runs nice and quiet too.  The battery life isn't the 16 hours advertised, I've been getting around 9-10, but I figure the battery just needs to be broken in.  It still beats the iPod by a mile.  Ok, I gotta go, but I hope this helps people.  If I have time, maybe I'll come back and expand on this review.  IN SHORT, I love this unit.  It's perfect for me and does everything I need.  People who are just looking for an mp3 player only should consider iPod.  If you want power, awesome sound quality, battery life, large array of functions, and are willing to put up with some minor inconveniences, then get this.

[title]:Great player - but could use improvements in firmware.
[fullText]:I've purchased my HD-340 last week, having upgraded from my RioRiot (20Gig).  It does everything it claims to do and quite well.  The sound output is sufficient to drown out any other noise and the all the equalizer settings from SRS Labs really fills the sound quite nicely.  The screen display is bright, even in daylight and displays JPEG images from my 4 MegaPixel camera without conversions.  However, you might want to CAREFULLY read the specs and the manual:  1) there are two USB ports, one for Media and another for Data.  The Media port is USB 1.1 and the Data port is USB 2.0.  This is important because if you use a software plugin that recognizes the iRiver as a media device, you only get USB 1.1 (using the media port).  However, if you plug in the data port, the device shows up as a driver letter in Windows with USB 2.0 speed.  Use normal file copying to get your music over, or else you'll be spending days.  Don't worry, if you install the software, you get a program which runs each time you connect into the data port, which (re)builds the ID3 database on the device.  2) It would be nice if there was an option to display the Album Art in a MP3 file in the glorious display.  Hopefully a firmware update?  3) Browsing and selecting files to play can take more time than necessary.  It would be great if you could select by first letter and get to a subset.  If your artist name starts with an "L", expect to scroll through half the list, either way you go.  Hopefully another firmware update????  4) Accessories are not yet available (Nov 26, 2004) except for a better case, which also shows the screen.    5) The included case is extremely sturdy and protective, but only allows access to the "top" connections, the "lock" button on the side and the microphone on the other side.  You have to remove the device from the case if you want to change anything (although this should be understood, since the controls are in the center), but a clear plastic window could provide access to these buttons.  Although it sounds like I don't like it, that is far from the truth.  A better case and a small firmware patch would make it perfect.  The FM tuner and the ability to record via line-in, mic and tuner, the display, and the fact that the controls are flush with the unit and less likely to get damaged make this far better than any other harddrive based player out there.

[title]:Take care if the size is important for you
[fullText]:I am not adding anything to the great reviews of this product. I like all its features. However, the amazon review is incorrect describing the size of this puppy. The h340 is bigger than the h320, but the amazon description is the same! The h340 is like 0.2 inches thicker than the h320. No it's not a great difference, but somewhat makes the h340 bulkier than the h320. I own the h320 and I got the h340 from amazon, expecting a similar size and found the increased size a bit dissapointing. Anyway, a great product.

[title]:Good gadget, but literature misleading!!
[fullText]:I purchased the H340 last week.  Every piece of literature I read said the H340 plays WAV files.  Even the box it came in says it plays WAV files.  It doesn't!!!!  I'm an audiofile and store my CD collection on my PC in WAV format.  I was hoping I could simply copy these files to the H340.  Since it doesn't play WAV files (yet anyway, maybe a future firmware upgrade will add this functionality), I've spent hours ripping my CDs to MP3 files at 256 kbps.  Amazon.com offered to let me return the unit since the literature was misleading.  I've not yet decided though.  I do like that it includes a FM tuner, picture viewer, and color display, all for less than the price of a 40 GB iPod.

[title]:User Hostile
[fullText]:Despite the praise given to the iRiver, a prime reason to buy this device, is to show it to other designers as to what not to do when designing.  Before describing why it is bad, here is a quick run down of what it offers. It has lots of features. Beyond playing mp3 and wav files, it has an FM tuner, recording device, picture viewer, file storage, lines in, lines out, and even a carrying case.   It can also  be found for a comparitively reasonable price.  So why is it annoying to use. Well first, the buttons are small and close together. When the volume was to high once I went to lower it but manged to hit the nav button. I then was in navigation hell and couldn&#8217;t get out resulting in my ears being blasted into deafness. As for the Nav button, its not even the only Nav button. In fact sometimes, you have to hit the left arrow button or even worse, the record button. Of course, if you do not hold the record button long enough to get to the correct nav screen, that&#8217;s right you start recording when you don&#8217;t want  to.  When listening to the radio, it is not even easy to change between preset and non-preset channels. Therefore you may not get to the channel you want.  Of course, one might just buy it for listening to music. Frankly, when buying a digital music device I want an interface that&#8217;s a little bit more than a standard file tree. It has metadata such as artists and albums, it should not be hard to get to them and have all their songs play. With the iRiver your stuck to navigate through sometimes lengthy file trees.  In a nutshell, if you need lots of features, this may work for you. You will, however, have to deal with an incredibly user unfriendly device.

[title]:THIS IS A VERY GOOD MP3 PLAYER
[fullText]:I HAVE READ ALOT OF THE REVIEWS ON THE IRIVER, AND I CAN ONLY SURMISE THAT : SOME OF THESE PEOPLE DO NOT OWN THE IRIVER PLAYER, OR THEY WORK FOR IPOD. SOMEBODY SAID THAT THE SOUND WAS MUFFLED. WELL THEY MUST WORK FOR IPOD. ALL DIGITAL SOUND IS CLEAN. IT'S THE BIT RATE THAT PLAYS A LARGE PART IN THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND, AND THE SPEAKERS YOU HEAR IT THRU.  IRIVER HAS TERRIBLE EARPHONES. I USE THE SONY MDR SERIES AND THE SOUND IS VERY CRISP. AFTER ALL WHAT YOU HEAR IS THE SPEAKERS, NOT THE MP3 PLAYER. SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT IRIVER OVERSTATED THE BATTERY LIFE. IN THE MANUAL IT SAY'S THAT 16 HOURS OF BATTERY LIFE IS EXPECTED AT 128 BIT RATE. MOST OF MY MUSIC IS BETWEEN 192 AND 600 BIT RATE. DO I GET 16 HOURS OF BATTERY LIFE? I DON'T KNOW, AS I CHARGE IT WHEN I'VE USED HALF OF THE LIFE. FOR ME THAT'S ABOUT 5 HOURS OF USEAGE.  DON'T LET BIG INDUSTRY (IPOD) CONVINCE YOU THAT THEY MAKE A BETTER MOUSETRAP, THAT'S JUST HYPE.

[title]:A firmware upgrade could bring this close to perfection
[fullText]:I did a lot of research on MP3 players before settling on the H340 and I am very happy with my decision. I decided against going with an iPod because of the built in restrictions on sharing between computers and the way it adds some encoding to all the mp3 files so that it cannot function effectively as a backup of your music. None of this nonsense with the iRiver H340, just plug it in to any computer's USB port and it shows up like a hard drive, no software required (except for Win 95/98 which requires a driver, and I can't speak for the Mac end of things). This is super convienient and the way that all MP3 players should work in an ideal world. I also strongly considered the Creative NX Xtra since it is available in a 60GB drive and I have a ton of music files but the reports of poor reliability and faulty headphone jack made me steer clear of that one.  The H340 feels very solid and sturdy and I find it quite intuitive and easy to use. To me the sound quality seems good with the supplied ear phones and I have not found the need to change them. It has some nice bells and whistles like built in radio and a recorder (and yes you can record from the radio).  So now on to the reasons why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars. It's called a jukebox right? What's a juke box? All the jukeboxes I know are music playing machines where you can select and line up the songs you want to hear and all the songs selected will play in the order you selected them in. But that's not the way this little machine works. You can only line up one song to play while another is playing. You can not line up a series of songs to play without hooking it up to your computer and creating a playlist. For me that is the number 1 negative with this player. However the firmware is upgradable and there is some glimmer of hope that my player may be able to have this very impotant missing feature added some time in the future. The other negatives are just minor gripes. The way it recharges from USB is badly implemented, when recharging it cannot connect as a drive and vice versa. If you plug your unit into the USB by default it will start charging and you can not do anything with the player. In order to connect to your computer you must  disconnect it, power it up, and change the USB charging option to turn it off. So it is best just leave USB charging turned off alltogether.  I have taken up much of this review with negatives but I must stress that I am very happy with my purchase and I think the H340 is a wonderfull little device which could use a firmware upgrade to make it damn near perfect. Highly recommended.

[title]:Now a part of the iPod craze!
[fullText]:Trust me, I was the LAST person to buy an iPod. I was perfectly happy with my iRiver H140 (which I still love), and was sick to death of seeing those white headphones everywhere! But then I decided to get a tinier player for my walks to class and such. I tried out different smaller players and they all had some type of defect. An iPod Shuffle wasn't an option as the thing doesn't even have a screen. When these second-generation minis came out, I was blown away by the specs: supposedly 18 hours of battery life, price cut down fifty dollars, etc. So I went ahead and bought the blue version and yet to have any regrets. My review:  PROS:  // I did a battery test on this the afternoon I bought it. It wasn't even charged to full capacity, and on top of that, I played with it a lot, and it still ran continuously for about 23 hours. Amazing. One of the reasons I was hesitant about getting a first-generation mini was its battery life (about eight hours, I believe). Apple has definitely improved on this feature.  // iTunes, the software that you use to put music on your iPod, is great. You can make it automatically sync to your iPod or manually update. I choose the latter option as I have more music on my computer than will fit on a 4GB player. I thought having to use software would be annoying in comparison to hooking a player up like a regular hard drive and using the file tree method, but iTunes is simple and gets the job done. There are other programs you can use to manage your iPod, like MusicMatch, but iTunes seems to be the least clunky to me. Also, you DO NOT have to buy from the iTunes music store to work your iPod. You can even hide this option on the sidebar if you wish and make iTunes solely a music manager.  // So tiny! I have to admit that when I opened the box, I exclaimed, "It's SO cute!" It's basically the size of a credit card. A little slimmer, a little longer, but you get the idea. Even the package it comes in is very compact!  // Sound quality is absolutely superb. You'll listen to songs that you've heard on your computer or other MP3 player or whatever and hear nuances that you haven't heard before. Like I said, I have an iRiver, and while that has amazing quality too, you'll be surprised how crisp this little device sounds.  // Plenty of features. Notes, contacts, games (Music Quiz, Solitaire, Brick and Parachute), clock, alarm... I have yet to use any of these extras but I guess it's nice to know that they're there in case you do. I think more efficient features would be voice recording, FM tuner, etc.  // Scratch-resistant. All of my friends' iPods are scratched up like you wouldn't believe. The mini has a lot more resistance to scratches as it has an anodized aluminum case.  // Inuitive design. Everyone knows about the click wheel. I've handled lots of different players and Apple really wins in this area. The controls are underneath the wheel, so you don't have to worry about buttons bulging out on the exterior.  // Colors-- this is a pretty trivial point, but I was initially disappointed when these "new" colors came out. I thought the earlier model pastels were much prettier. However, now that I actually have one (photos don't do justice), I think my blue one has a gorgeous, rich hue, and I imagine this is the same for the green and pink. No complaints in the aesthetics department from my end.  CONS:  // No support for WMAs. iTunes will import these as their own format, which might result in a sound degradation. I had to rip a bunch of my CDs as MP3s just to retain original audio quality.  // Apple really skimped out on the accessories. I'm used to getting a bunch of add-ons with my player for free, like a case and adapter. The mini includes a clip-on holder, headphones, and your charging cord, but that's pretty much it. HOWEVER, to Apple's credit, you can charge your iPod without an adapter (right from USB, or Firewire). Plus, to get these 4GB models down cheaper than they were before, it makes sense that they cut out the superfluous items.  // This will be a minor issue for most people, but when you're in your menus (like listings under Songs or Albums or wherever), the titles don't scroll. So if you have a lot of songs that start with the same string of words, you're going to have try them all to see which one you're looking for. On the actual now-playing screen, they DO scroll, it's just that in the menus they don't. Like I said, this won't affect most people, but it did kind of annoy me when I first saw it as all other players I've worked with scroll titles in menus.  SOME THINGS TO KNOW:  // The iPod never actually shuts off. I know that when I first got this, I was like, "Where's the stop button?!" You can put it to sleep by holding the play/pause button down for a few seconds, but it will never actually be turned off. This is a smart move made by Apple because if you were to continually shut off and restart everytime you wanted to use it, not only would it take a long time to boot up, but it would wear down its interior.  // iPod doesn't give you a straightforward way to copy your music back onto your computer after putting it on, but there's a way to do so without using external programs if it's enabled to disk usage. 1) Click on the iPod icon in My Computer. 3) Click Tools > Folder Options > View > Show Hidden Files and Folders. 3) A folder called "iPod Control" should appear. Navigate into that folder and all your music should be in several different folders within. If you don't want to do it this way, there are also third-party programs like CopyPod.  // For iPod support, Google "iPodLounge." Their forums are really helpful, too.  // Ordering from Amazon is probably your best bet. I ordered this on March 17 and received it the very next day on March 18. That was with Super Saver Shipping deal where it's actually supposed to take up to two weeks to get to you! This could just be in my lucky case, but even so, you can also always return your iPod if something is wrong with it with zero hassle and for free. Like with those other players that gave me issues? Amazon sent a UPS guy to my house to pick it up, returned it, and I got ALL of my money back. Just my two cents on that.  ---  Overall, a great player. Besides a few flaws, Apple has found a new iPod-lover in me which I thought NEVER would happen! Sorry for the length of this review but I hope it helped potential buyers. Happy iPodding. :)

[title]:Incredibly Fast Shipping!
[fullText]:Cheers to Amazon! I bought this IPod as a gift for my fiancs burf-day, so I haven't even taken it out of the box yet, but I had to write a quick note singing their praises. Amazon's logistics and delivery network is unbelievable.  I opted for the free shipping offer (Super Saver Discount), which Amazon claims will ship in two to three days.  I placed the order around 2:00 PM CST, yesterday (3/21/05), only to have it show-up on my desk at work at 10:30 AM CST, today (3/22/05). That's a total of 20.5 hours for Super Saver Delivery.  I will say that my home in St. Louis, MO isn't extremely far from Amazon's distribution center in Lexington, KY, where this package was shipped from - about 350 miles.  But still, I've ordered pizza's that have taken longer to get here.  Way to go Amazon!

[title]:Very disappointing battery life
[fullText]:So I received my Ipod Mini last week (good job Amazon for the free shipping....which arrived very promptly) and I had a lot of trouble with iTunes. I had a 256 mb mp3 player before I bought my iPod and transferring music to that one was so much easier. With iTunes, you have to make sure every song you want on your iPod is in the library. Thus if you add songs from a different computer, the songs that are not in this new library will be deleted! I guess this protects illegal music sharing, but for something this expensive this is a very inconvenient feature. Basically I think iTunes is an inferior program for transferring music; on my old mp3 player you could just drag and drop music files into the player.  Most importantly, the battery life of my iPod is absolutely disappointing. I've had to charge it every 2 days since the day I received it, and it's not like I keep it on all the time. I just use it when I walk to class, and in a span of 2 days it is actually on for about no more than 6 hours. I don't even have the backlight setting on at all. I am extremely upset with this because the 18 hour battery life is what initially hooked me into buying this second generation version.  Apple is lucky the iPod has such a good interface. The scroll wheel I must admit is a very intelligent tool and the ability to make playlists is something flash drive based mp3 players can't do. For 190 dollars I got a second generation iPod that has EXTREMELY poor battery life and that's why I am so upset with this. If anyone else has had problems with their battery, please share. It's better to know I'm not the only one who got gypped!

[title]:What is Wrong With iTunes?
[fullText]:I love my iPod and iTunes, and simply can not see why people dislike iTunes.  A previous reviewer said that they couldn't transfer songs from another computer.  BULL.  Just right click on the iPod, and change it to manual synchronization.  Even if you don't like iTunes, there are many other applications, such as iPod Agent, that can transfer music (and more) to your iPod that are available online for free.  Especially with the new price, IPODS ROCK!

[title]:Wonderful.
[fullText]:I have a tremendous amount of music - too much for an iPod of any current size - and so I knew that I would be moving music on and off of the device no matter what.  I chose the smallest iPod Mini because of its good price and physical dimensions (it's a lot smaller than most people think), and have been very, very happy with my purchase.  I am something of an audiophile, and yet have been very pleased with the Mini's impressive sound quality, its ease of use, the incredible battery life (18 hours is not much of an exageration) and the flexibility that the Mini provides me.  To be only slightly critical (and not to discourage anyone from enjoying an awesome device), I am not especially fond of Apple's ear-buds (and a bit uncomfortable, too), but they were easily replaced for even better sound.  Also, I do wish that I could turn off the "auto-pause" feature (the unit pauses automatically when the earphones are removed, but is so sensitive as to occasionally pause when the plug is inadvertently rotated).  These are minor criticisms, and I hope that everyone gets an iPod!

[title]:Great, but bruises as easily as an apple....  Poor for audio books (no bookmarks)
[fullText]:This is my first Ipod and I love it.  The functionality is excellent and I've found that it lives up to nearly all of the positive notes that others here and elsewhere have written.  However, I have two complaints: One that would not have changed my purchase decision, and another that would have made me buy an accessory earlier.  First, the battery life is nowhere near 18 hours.  I do not use the backlight, nor do I play it very loud.  Perhaps the best I have done with battery life is 7-10 hours.  I was so surprised at first that I thought I had accidentally purchased the fist generation Mini.  I confirmed that I had the second one. But again, I would still purchase this, regardless.  Second, get a case or some other protective cover!  I dropped mine twice outside.  Both times were from only a foot or two but were on pavement or asphalt.  The Ipod worked flawlessly without any problems at all. But, drops that may have only slightly scratched a plastic case resulted in several small but very noticeable dings and even an actual dent on the corner.  The metal used for these cases must be pretty soft or pretty cheap! If you want to keep your Mini looking clean and new over time, and you occasionally have two left hands, you will definitely want to get some type of case or cover for it.  8/31/05:   After using the iPod for months, I realized that it missed a great feature I had on my old Rio 500: the ability to bookmark!  I listen to audio books a little more than I listen to music.  Though I understand there is an ability to bookmark Audible books and that there are various hacks and tricks out there, there is NO way to easily bookmark an audio book that you may have imported from CD or elsewhere.  I cannot change my original rating, but: For music, I would keep it at 4 stars.  For Audio books, the iPod deserves 1 star!  If you listen primarily to audio books, look elsewhere for a player that allows you to easily bookmark your spot.  12/22/05:  Battery life stinks!  I use this mostly for audio books and podcasts, and the best I can get is 2-3 hours before the battery dies.  Apple support is the worst!  I sent it back to them for repair: they received it on a Thursday or Friday, and sent it back on a Monday, stating that it was up to their standards.  If I was not now "captive" by having converted many CDs to Apple format, I would dump the Ipod altogether.

[title]:Bad News
[fullText]:Deceptive  I bought this MP3 player because the Creative Web site promised "Easy Transfer -- Simple drag and drop your data files between ZEN V and your computer.  No complicated or messy driver installations necessary."  However this does not seem to be the case.  I love Creative's MP3 Muvo player.  No software needed to load that player up with MP3s.  The Muvo shows up as a USB mass storage drive, so one just has to drag and drop his MP3s and data to the Muvo, using nothing more than Windows Explorer -- just like any other thumbdrive.  I researched the Zen V first on Creative's site, and the language implies that loading the Zen V was as simple as loading the Muvo or any thumbdrive.  However, one apparently does need software to load the Creative Zen V.  Moreover, apparently one also needs an Internet connection to install the software.  Why do I need to go to the Internet when all I want to do is load this MP3 player with my music and images?  I tried to install the software, but it wouldn't install after I told Zone Alarm not to allow the  install software to go to the Internet.    There is no language on the outside of the box that says you need to install software to use the player, or that you need an Internet connection.    I attached the unit to my computer via the USB connection to see if it would show up as a USB mass storage device, and it did not.  The "Play for Sure" icon on the back was sticker out; apparently Creative had second thoughts after they put out the product, and decided not to support that function.  Moreover, the player will not work in Windows 2000 (though it does say you need Windows XP on the box).  I also suspect that the Creative software might be phoning home, and telling the mothership what you are listening to. I see no other urgent need to go to the Internet, unless I make that decision myself.  In short, the packaging and the product is deceptive. Which is really too bad because I love the Muvo, and was eyeing the larger Zen Vision: M model.  Now I'm going to have to reconsider the Archos solutions.

The battery lasts a long time too which is nice, once you charge it completely the first time you only have to charge it about once every week and a half, depending on how often you use it. Its also really small and light it almost disappears in your hand, but the screen looks awesome for such a small device.  Also, fyi creative actually sued apple in 2006 for infringement of the zen patent, the case was settled for $612 million

The screen shows the length of a downloaded book, how much time you've listened to and how much time is left.  You can use the joystick to move forward and back within the book.  This device is also supported by my public library, and I can download some books for free. If you shut down the player while a book is playing the unit will usually return to where you left off, and the bookmarking feature offers additional protection.  The unit has frozen several times when I was attempting to navigate too fast, but I've discovered that the earring post I'm always wearing becomes a great way to reset the player.   It is incredible to have an entire book in my purse!  Great little player for the money.

[title]:Three week lifespan
[fullText]:I had some concerns proir to purchasing this after reading reviews on the Amazon, NewEgg and other websites.  It appears you've got a 50-50 chance of getting a good one.  I took a chance and got the lemon.  I lost all confidence when I finally got though to the RCA techies, and their response was "yeah, these have issues, not really sure why".    Having to carry around a toothpick to reboot this everytime it freezes is not my idea of a quality product.  Not that I use this often, maybe an hour a day, if that but when the backlight gave out, it was time to send back.  Kudos to Amazon's return policy and I'll take the refund to purchase something else.

[title]:Very good if...
[fullText]:I had one of these for about a year before my little brother yanked it down from the desk and righit onto hard wood, it still worked, but the screen died, and i didnt feel like replacing it, so i just got something else. But like I said, if youve ever used an iPod or iTunes, you know that their very easy to use, and Creative isnt quite as good but their catching up. Now they may be harder to use (for the first week until you get used to them) but Creative PACKS this thing with tons of extra stuff, im too lazy to list them, but i would definately buy this over an iPod nano if you know how to work, and figure out how to use things well, but if you just want something siple to use, and iPod might be better, but if you just want to play music (and not use the extra features on the Zen V) then its a pretty simple music player.

[title]:bad design, bad quality
[fullText]:We bought this for my daughter for Christmas last year, and she took excellent care of it.  In March the joystick controller split in two.  It seems like this is pretty common problem, but Creative would not fix it.  I ended up buying another broken one and replacing the joystick myself.  But in Sept. the screen backlight died.  I am really disapointed in both the customer service and quality of this product and will not buy another Creative product again

[title]:Outstanding portable recorder... with one major flaw.
[fullText]:If you have old tapes and records you would like to be able to archive, put into your computer or other MP3 player, and/or burn CD copies of, this is the the portable media player/ recorder for you...but it has one MAJOR flaw*  A line in jack (odd 2.5mm, but adaptable) is a very rare thing on a portable media player/ recorder, and this has one...add to that it's VU meters and it's close to perfect for making digital copies of any audio source including your old analog recordings. That's right it actually has a line in jack AND VU meters..how sweet is that? With an adapter ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3GPIS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-0691807-1803628">Audio Adapter - Rca - Mini-phone Stereo 3.5 Mm (m)</a> ) you can jack it right in to your stereo system..with the included 2.5mm to 3.5mm cable you can jack into anything with a standard stereo 3.5mm headphone/ output jack.  Recoding is encoded at 128 or 160Kbps MP3..ok so it.s not high end top  notch audio, but it's just fine for cassettes,LPs, 45s, radio, and yes even your old 8-track cartridges. 320 Kbps would have been better, but 160 is adequate.  It also has a built in mono microphone that makes decent sounding recordings.  ..and yes it'll play your audio and video files, and display pictures too... just like everything else, bla, bla ,bla. Nothing new there.  Audio output is not very loud, but it does have a real user adjustable five band equalizer.  Battery life is about 9-12 hrs...Uh... battery..battery...WHERE'S THE BATTERY?  * THE BATTERY IS NOT USER REPLACEABLE. IMHO that's inexcusable. When it goes dead on you and you're away from home you're sunk. Likewise when it'll no longer hold a charge. The only way to replace the battery is to literally pry the case apart or have it replaced by a technician!  As a recorder I'd give it an 8/10.  As a portable media player I'd give it 2/10 because of the battery issue alone...where it not for that I'd say 7/10.. sounds good for what it is, but I wish it had more output power.

[title]:A Small Piece of Garbage for a Big Price
[fullText]:This product was an insurance replacement for my previous Flashtrax.  I very much regret this purchase.  My photography store only carried these at the time, so I really had no choice since the Insurance Company put them in charge of replacing my goods.  Here are some of my reasons:  1) 8bit file system. Not only do I use this product for my photography, but I use it as an MP3 player and to transport files.  Unless you plan on time warping your computer back about 10 years, to an archaic 8bit file system, the truncation if files is an extreme annoyance. ie: "myfilename001.jpg" becomes "myfile~1.jpg" and Elvis Presley-Rubberneckin.mp3 becomes "elvi~1.mp3"  Finding the MP3 you want; forget about it.  2) File Sorting Lord have mercy on your soul if you listen to Audio Books.  I do.  Let's assume that I have time to rename 150 mp3 chapters of my audio book if 8 letters or less filenames.  Then I HOPE that each file was created/modified in order - You see, the P-2000 sorts files and folders according to DATE and TIME.  It's incapable of sorting files by filename!! You can't create any play lists OR listen to mp3s in order alphabetically or numerically!  3) Slow Copying files from my Sandisk Extreme III 82x 1gig CF card is slow and painful.  Hope you have a back up battery.  4) Highly Proprietary OS. Ok, so using the P-2000 for MP3's is useless, but at least I still have my photography, yeah?  So I've copied a fresh batch of Canon files to the P-2000 and wish to put them in a folder for viewing (they call them albums).  What the?!  Why are all of my files being copied, then renamed to some Epson proprietary naming system!?  My immaculate Canon file naming system is apparently not good enough this lil baby.  Instead of simply renaming the, the unit COPIES the files into the new files with new names taking up a lot of time, and wear and tear on the hard drive.  Also, can you say "bye bye battery?"  In general, using the file system with Windows file explorer is difficult.  Folders (or albums) that you see while using the unit are not the same that you see in Windows explorer  Example, Lets say you want to create a new folder to throw other photos in from you HDD.  Sorry, no.  You have to use Epson's proprietary "album creating" steps to do this.  Apparently Epson is still learning how to use a standard file system.  So now you're created a folder called "Photos from September 04th 2005; logically, you should be able to plug in your USB in and just copy your files over, yeah?  Sorry, no.  Now you have to find the CODE name Epson gave this album in you folder list.  Just finding the folder with the name you gave it would be too easy.  Epson called mine "ALBM0254." This meant that I had to search about 250 folders to find the one I just created.  I hoped "ALBM0254"  was the right one to copy my files into.  The best way to know for sure, is to put one file into the folder, unplug the device from the UBS, turn it on, browse to folder 254, see if the file is in there, if it is then plug it back in and copy the rest of the files over.  If not, well, try again.  5) Bad Battery?  Too bad. According to Epsons documentation, , using the P-2000 without a battery (AC Only) will damage the unit.  So, if my battery fails me at some point, and I have the day's worth of pictures on this unit, I am unable to recover them until I call Epson and order another proprietary battery. $80.  Until then my clients will just have to wait till a new battery shipped out to me.   6) Media Support Not all it's hyped up to be.  I haven't yet found a proper AVI/Mpeg that it can play.  It claims to be able to play QuickTime .MOV files, but the only one that I've gotten to play (aside from the sample it came with) was some weird and obscure music video I found on the net.  As the only playable MOV file that I've found, I keep it on my P-2000, so I can watch it every now and then feel like I haven't been raped by Epson.  If Cavemen had Portable Photo-Storage units, they'd have P-2000s;  Old technology based software and OS  7) Extra Stuff: I was spoiled by the accessories that came with my Flashtrax.  I got a remote control (which I honestly did use) and external Video / Audio cables to connect to my TV/Stereo.  The Epson does not come with those.  8) Technical Support. I have tried to contact Epson (Canada) in regards to the file sorting issues (twice) over the last week, however I have not heard back from them yet.    To be fair, this unit is much sturdier than my previous Flashtrax (after all, cavemen use it), and the battery life is excellent.  The screen and picture are excellent.

[title]:Great Screen, Primitive Software
[fullText]:The screen on this baby is gorgeous, but the people who wrote the software need to go play with a few MP3 players and similar devices to get a clue on usability.  The user's guide tells you that you may only copy files to a particular folder on the device; then you have to unplug it from the PC, power it up, and move the files to an Album by punching buttons.  It's been noted that all photos copied to it get rewritten with cryptic Epson file names to cryptically name Epson folders, which makes it next to impossible to totally manage the device from your PC.  The alternative is wearing your thumb out punching buttons to do it on the P2000 itself.  Sorting is done only by date/time, so if you retouch just a few of your vacation pictures on your PC, and then copy all your photos over to show the relatives, you are hosed unless you modify date/time on all photos.  Zoom in is a great feature, my only complaint is there is no single button push to back out to normal size.  Would I buy this one again?  I'd have to look really hard at alternative products.  Am I sorry I own the P2000?  No - I've learned to deal with it.

[title]:Found a way to view Avis!
[fullText]:One of my disappointments with the P2000, which I really like, was the inability to view the avis I get from my Canon camera.  I tried converting to mpeg4, but the simpler mpeg4 conversions are visually poor.  Someone recommended the program Video Vault PVP to me and it is easy to use.  All I have to do is tell it I want to convert the file for use on the P2000 (or I imagine the P4000).  The conversion process is very fast, the video excellent, and the compression makes for a much smaller file.  (...)I wish the transfer of a one gig card full of images went a bit faster and there was an external charger available for the unit. Isabel

[title]:Not reliable enough for photo backups on the go 
[fullText]:This is a nice portable viewer but do not buy it to use to copy photos from your memory cards in the field, it is not reliable enough for that.  I stored over 13 gigs of photos on it during a recent trip and two folders of over 300 photos "disappeared".  I could not view or download the photos.  I thought they were lost or corrupted, but I was able to recover them using the $200 OnTrack Easy Recovery Program. Although it was the only way I would have recovered my photos, Epson later told me not to use it.  I also had problems with the battery not charging within the first week and even problems running the unit on AC power.  All this happened in the first month I had the unit, but Epson would not refund or replace the unit.  I sent it to them for warranty service and it came back quickly with no explanation of what they did.  I have no confidence I can save photos to this unit as backup, which is the reason I bought it. If you are willing to spend this much on a portable viewer, it is excellent, but if you want a reliable tool to backup photos on the go, DON'T BUY THE EPSON P-2000 or P-4000, stick with a laptop.

I also wanted to use it to watch movies; I fly alot. Anyway... I read MANY reviews saying it was very difficult to create a file it would accept. THIS WAS TRUE UNTIL NOW. If you own this unit and want to watch your favorite film simply get VIDEO VAULT PVP EDITION. Google "Video Vault" and you'll find it.  Working with the program is super easy, video quality is fantastic. I now travel with no fewer than a dozen movies. Too cool.

[title]:Needs some improvement, but what an awesome device!
[fullText]:I've been a professional photographer for about 20 years, but I did have a hiatus in that span in which photography fell by the wayside. I've gotten back into the craft and for the most part, I have kissed film goodbye - and I would have bet my left arm that would never happen. I just bought a new digital outfit to begin my new venture into the photo biz and asked an acquaintance who is a freelance photographer and who is sent on assignment by such publications as Time & Life. He recommended the P-2000 when I asked his opinion on the best device out there to use in the field to clear out CF cards and after getting to handle one in person, I agreed with him and bought mine 2 weeks ago.  The image quality is STUNNING. There is no other way to put it. Colors are crisp & sharp on the moderate-sized display and the controls are iPod-ishly intuitive and easy to operate.  There are some things I believe should be done to make the next incarnation a 5-star achiever:  1.) This puppy really needs to have a firewire port. Say what you will about USB 2.0 - on a Mac, Firewire is simply faster. I have a USB 2.0 port on my iMac, but this thinig is too freakin' slow in importing images via USB to the computer. This is a device for professionals - I'd say can the SD slot in favor of a firewire port!  2.) The charging port is on the opposite side of where the lanyard attaches. ... so, if you want this to charge while in its protective case, you have to turn the lanyard  in the case and have it charging in an awkward position.  3.) They seriously need to come out w/ an external battery charger. I do not see the point of buying a separate battery if there is no charger other than the unit itself.  4.) The delay between clicking on a thumbnail and/or zoominig in is WAY TOO LONG. Sometimes, it's zooms in fast, and other times it feels like an ice age is going to pass you by while you wait.  5.) It is way too picky on video formats. The example/demo video that came w/ the unit is a .mov Quicktime file - but I have quicktime files that play fine on my Mac that won't play on this thing. Granted, I will primarily be using this as a professional companion in photoshoots, not as a video player - but you get the idea.  6.)  Where you put in the CF card, it needs to be labled more clearly on the orientation so you don't jam it in backwards.  7.) When the disk is full and you want to import the photos into iPhoto - it takes FOREVER. I have imported photos from external hard drives, CDs and DVDs before, but this is the slowest EVER. I shot a wedding rehearsal and the wedding itself - well over 2000 photos in about 14 hours of activities over 2 days. I got home and hooked this puppy up at 4pm and started importing photos. I went about my day, took a nap and about a few minutes to midnight, went to look at the photos and they were STILL importing! Only about 75% had been imported. I don't know if this is a 2000 rpm drive or if it's a USB 1.0 or what its shortcomings are in the speed dept., but yikes, it takes way too stinking long!  Despite its shortcomings, it is a fast downloader from CF to the drive while in the field. Not as fast as I'd like, but decent. I used this device yesterday during a photoshoot in which I took bridal portraits for about 3 hours. I imported over 700 photos and the bride viewed many of them, zooming in on several - and half the battery life remains. This device pays for itself in just saving the cost of larger capacity CF cards over time. Thus far, I am very pleased with this purchase.

[title]:Epson P-2000 Multi-Media Viewer
[fullText]:I received this item in the mail about 3 weeks ago and i have thoroughly enjoyed it.  I picked this up so that on my 2 week trip out of the country, i would not have to lug around a lot of heavy electronic equipment (i.e. laptop, chargers, etc...) in addition to my camera, lenses and flash cards.  As travelling by air has gotten a lot more challenging.  this little item will afford me nearly 40 gigs of storage for my RAW images and JPEGS.  I can shoot whatever i want and not have to worry about running out of room on my flash cards.  A note though.  Most reviews state that it takes about 1-3min to download a CF card full of pictures.  i have found that if you have a lot of RAW images, then, it takes quite a bit longer.  it took nearly 20-24 min to download my 4 gig card.  So, i still have to bring my charger and Voltage converter for Europe.  I also noted a lot of praise for the Video Vault program.  I tried it and i found that often on my movies  the sound was off of the video about 3-4 seconds later.  so, i downloaded a free trial of dvdclone mobile (i set it for itunes video and viola'!  No more worries.)  AAAAAAAAAAnd, it was a bit cheaper.    The Epson P has a standard sd card and a CF card slot.  so, it is child's play to pop it outta the camera and plug it in.  the product manual shows you how.  it downloads quickly and reminds you to plug it in if you are going to be downloading off your cards for too long.    the picture viewer is awesome and allows you to zoom in on your pictures so you can spot fuzziness and poor quality quickly!  (instead of looking at a tiny 2 or 2 1/2inch lcd screen.)   Highly recommended!!!.  for the reviewer that lost 2 or 3 files inexplicably and that does not trust this device.  One word of advice, download the card while the charger is connected--you copy the card,then, you page through the images to insure everything is there you want---then, you format your card after you are sure it's there. it says in the manual that if you download stuff on battery and you run outta juice--it might not copy correctly or at all.  i haven't had any problems while utilizing this device to it's fullest capacity.  I now travel with 12 or 15 movies on the hard drive.  When it's time for work, i delete a movie and free up a gig and a half.  or, i delete everything and have nearly 36 gigs of photo fun!!  (i haven't used that much space yet, but, we'll see--italy is right around the corner).  5 stars!  way to go Epson!! (for all those missed connections)

[title]:Excellent Out of the Package Experience
[fullText]:I picked up the 2.5 gb version of this Rave MP3 player this past weekend and have been VERY impressed with its capabilities.  The smaller version cost me $159 (before a $20 mail in rebate) and - having owned a number of MP3 players previously (Muvo, Lyra, etc.) - I have always found something lacking.  This particular unit's manufacturer seems to have listened to consumer's complaints before releasing the model, because it really is a top line product.  It works right out of the package - you can actually plug it in and listen and sync items from your computer immediately, although you'll have to wait a full five hours initially before you can get an 8 to 10 hour battery life as a stand alone device.   What I REALLY like about this unit is that it syncs flawlessly with Windows Media Player, Version 10.  You simply plug it in - no software needed - with the supplied USB cable...and then you open Windows Media Player and use the pull down menu to sync items to the Rave player.  You can have it do it automatically, or you can do it manually.  And yes - it works with stuff that you've downloaded from MSN music...or Rhapsody...or Napster.  Very few MP3 players have the capability to do that with multiple music sources.  The sound clarity is fine, although I would suggest you invest in a better pair of ear buds.  The supplied ones work ok, but there are much better units (try the Sony Fontopia series) available for around $25.00.  The radio tuner works as advertised...and you can store your favorite radio stations.  All in all, a FINE unit and well worth your hard earned dollars.

[title]:Good if you buy for under $200, tons of features
[fullText]:Disregard the review below.  This unit turned into a piece of garbage just after I wrote this and it is now sitting in a landfill.  Thank you govideo and rave-mp for being a horrible company!  I bought this on eBay for $160 after shipping.  My wife and I have used this mainly while working out at the gym and it would be great for people who are active and want to bring their music with them.  The sound quality isn't the best, especially with the ear-bud headphones provided, but you can mess with the equalizer so that if you get it just right, the sound is pretty good on better headphones.  The mp3 player works fine with XP and Windows Media player 9 or later, but the one beef I have is that it takes forever to update the library if you add or edit files on the player.  Rave-MP doesn't support Windows playlist features yet, but they emailed me and said that a firmware update in January would add the playlist option.  It's January 24th and I still haven't seen the firmware update, so they have a week until I start bugging them again.  This player takes absolutely forever to power up.  You hit the power button and then watch the Rave MP screen for probably 15+ seconds.  It's really annoying in you're in a hurry.    I haven't needed to use the voice recorder so I haven't yet but I'm sure if I were an investigative reporter I would love it.  Or if I liked to record voice memos for myself I guess.  The FM tuner is nice to have but if you want to record from the radio, the bitrate is really low so it'd only be good if you wanted to hear the name of a song or if you got lucky and won something from the radio station and wanted to record the joyous moment.  Other than recording the FM tuner is great for just listening to the radio.  Battery life could be better but what can you do, it's an integrated battery I guess.  Battery life is around the low side of the projected life or about 8hrs I'd say.  I do wonder though how much a replacement battery would cost in a unit like this when it decides to stop charging in a few years or who-know-how-long.  All-in-all, I've enjoyed having this mp3 player.  If you have to have the best sound available, I would pass on this unit, otherwise it's pretty good and you can find it for super cheap usually on eBay.  I've seen them for as low as $130 there.  Holy cheap mp3 player Batman!

[title]:Problems - 
[fullText]:I bought the 2.5 model. It seemed to work fine, but then I wanted to delete some songs. There was no instructions. I called customer service, they told me to hook it up to the computer and just use plain old delete. Well that's what I did. Soon after I noticed that the player wasn't working quite right. It would begin to play the songs on the player, but stop halfway through. Couldn't figure it out. I called customer service and they kept telling me it was user error. Well, after the warrenty wore out, I figured out what the problem was. The titles to the deleted songs were still in the playlist, and when they couldn't be found on the player - the player would just hang. So I called and told them this was the problem - well they said your warrenty is up - I said this problem happened way before the warrenty was up, but they wanted me to pay $89 to replace the unit - I asked them if I could download the software and reload it as that might clear the player, and even though the manual says that software for it is downloadable, they told me I couldn't download the player system software. Not only is the player worthless so is the company.

Once you've been through the "slide show" once, the images load quicker the second time. Had no proplems uploading and downloading from my computer. No problems downloading directly from my camera's card. Overall I am quite happy with my purchase. Screen gives a very good image. Very clear and crisp. Worked great while we were traveling.

After spendidng hours creating a 700 picture file on my computer and transfering it to the Viewer in the order I wanted them presented, I learned from Epson Tech Support this feature is not currently availble on the P-2000.  I explained my reasoning for wanting them viewed in a certain order, and tech support said this may be available in a future update. Other than this, I am enjoying the P-2000 to store and view my photos.

[title]:P-2000 is unreliable
[fullText]:I am a professional photographer and have relied on the P-2000 and a redundant Dell notebook for photo storage in the field.  The P-2000 corrupted about 10% of files downloaded from several CF cards (Lexar Professional 133x media).  The corruption is transparent until the files are unloaded to a desktop.  The original files on the CF card remained intact and error free.  On a recent wildlife shoot in East Africa I returned to discover that more than 300 of 3000 plus frames were not retrievable.  What makes matters worse for the P-2000 is that it cannot be repaired in the field.  One cannot restore its operating software from an external source and the cost of doing so is prohibitively more than the instrument is worth.  I will not invest in another one, personally.

[title]:Support and repair are sub par
[fullText]:The Epson P2000 and family are not properly supported by epson. You cannot send the device to Epson for repair, even under warranty. You have to use an "authorized Service Center." In the Boston area I was given 4 service centers to choose from. 3 had no idea what a p2000 was and would not repair or support it. The 4th was a horror story in itself. Months of effort to get the repair and return. They could not repair it so had to send it to a repair facility (Epson). But had no idea of how to do so. Calling Epson was little help because the help desk cannot talk to the internal repair facility or check on the repair status. Only the Authorised service center can. Months of trying finally had the device returned to me and the screen failed within a short time just after the warranty ran out. I was given the option of taking it back to the "authorised repair facility" which I have sworn will never get my business again. So... I have pulled the drive out of it, pulled my files off of it. and it sits in a drawer as an expensive reminder of what not to trust.

[title]:Beautiful hardware - Terrible software
[fullText]:This potential "ipod killer" can hardly stand up on its own (feet) because of terrible software design. The player itself is beautiful and the designers ought to be proud of that but the software is a huge letdown. In the age of drag and drop mp3 players to have a propreitary software that is nonintuitive and full of bugs is a crime. I did all the updating but the transfer part kept hanging up on two mp3 files while allowing me no chance to exclude them. I finally deleted them and tried again. Everything seemed to transfer fine but the player itself would not play with the announcement "retry synchronization." Further attempts locked up my otherwise stable home-built, superbly cared for machine running windows 2000. Even though I'd be [...], I'm returning this thing.

[title]:A Fantastic MP3 player
[fullText]:I work at a RadioShack and we just got these in a week or so ago (mid September.) We had been getting a lot of inqueries about the iPods we carried but no one wanted to pay the price for them! Then we saw these in our add and they looked fantastic. They showed up and everyone that works at the store wanted one.  The included earphones have good enough sound and are designed like the iPod earbuds. Saying they are uncomfortable or comfortable is a matter of ear size and shape but most that have demo-ed the unit have liked them. The face looks sleek and high-end but you may want to get screen protectors or the cases for the m:robe that look a lot like the cases for the iPod. The unit itself has a really good sound but if you like really deafening yourself you'd want to get the updates that give you even more volume. Its always a good idea to get any free updates for whatever product you have. If you're going to carry it in your pocket use the HOLD button and it won't allow input from the touchscreen. Super fast transfers with USB1 or 2. A few hang-ups with the transfer software but was fixed with the updates. Great amount of space (5 GBs! around 1200 songs in MP3 format.) Bottom line: If you want an MP3 player and don't NEED 40+ gigs of space this unit is perfect. Fantastic price even at its higher prices online. Great quality, great accessories, always new firmware/software updates that continue to improve the unit, and a customer replaceable battery! The included battery is said to take over 500 charges and is easily replaceable and inexpensive. Take care of your unit and you'll love it forever!

I am not a computer retard.. i know a lot about them.  This is quality hardware (the same cpu as the apple ipod the pp5020) but absolutly crap for software.  By software i mean the music managment software (mtrip) and the firmware and software within the mrobe.  It really pisses me off that a player that costs over $100 can have such poor quality control.  Save your money for another month and get an ipod mini.

[title]:Very Nice Alternative To Ipod
[fullText]:In this day and age where it seems everyone has an ipod it feels good to have something noone else has, which is the m:robe 100.  Coolness factor is definately there and I've gotten lots of attention from ironically ipod owners themselves.  The player itself works fine, just as well as any other player.  The sound can be a bit on the softer side but it's loud enough for when I want it to be loud.  The only weakness is again like people have mentioned, the software.  It's not very user-friendly.  However, it's something that hopefully you won't be doing often, like me, so you'll only have to deal with it once.  Other than that, it's great.  Remember to get better earbuds because the one's included are like the apple earbuds, which aren't very good.

[title]:Value for the price
[fullText]:Like another reviewer of this item, I work at a Radio Shack.  We too recently got in the M:Robe.  I now own one, and I found that the following comments are true:  The volume is much too low when you get the thing out of the box. That was very discouraging for me.  However, like several of its other glitches this is easily solved by going to Olympus's website and downloading updates.  The volume is fine now that I've upgraded, I like my music loud and it certainly provides.  When it comes to upgrades you'd better have easy access to your USB port, because removing the cord from the base while it's plugged into the AC requires either long fingernails or surgeon tools.   The software is a pain.  You have to sync up the player to your playlist every time you want to add new music, and that can take a long time.  However, once done, the player is easy to use. Perhaps for the next version Olympus will realize that Mp3 transfer through explorer is a much easier option.  However, I did notice that one glitchy track I had (it had skips on it even as an Mp3) was fixed when I played it on the M:robe.  So maybe the software does have a benefit!  When you set the player on random it can take a couple of seconds for it to decide which track to play next, that is unless it does what it loves to do occasionally, which is playing the next alphabetical track or two before picking at random again.   The headphones are highly average, even for earbuds.  Mine came out of the box with uneven cord lenghts.  They work, but $10 can buy you a much better pair of Sonys.    I gave the player 4/5 stars because I would have liked to have a radio with it.  Also, switching tracks is a bit cumbersome, but once you figure out how it makes sense.  The keypad is very sensative, but responsive as well.  That all being said, once the thing's software is updated the player works fine and there aren't any major complaints, and you are getting a good deal - 5 gigs usually runs $100 more. And lets not forget how cool red looks on black!

[title]:If you are even considering this player -- just buy it
[fullText]:Radio Shack had the M:Robe in stock for $130 less a $30 mail-in rebate.  I have had this MP3 player for only one day, but price/performance deserves a 5-star rating.  That, and I also believe it is the best looking and most durably constructed MP3 player on the market.  I don't think you need to hide it in a case, because it is constructed of metal and glass.  It is not going to get scratched up.  I read a lot of reviews of the M:Robe before buying it.  Some earlier ones complained about it not playing loud enough, or freezing up.  These problems have been fixed, so as soon as I got it out of the box, I applied the latest software updates Olympus has come up with.  Just do it!    Here is the quickest way to set the M:Robe up:    Attach AC power cord to transformer, and transformer to docking station.  Place M:Robe in docking station.  Attach USB cable to docking station and position near your main PC.  The M:Robe will start to charge the battery.  This will take about 3 hours, so you have plenty of time update software and upload CDs.  Load the enclosed CD and install the m-trip software.  It will give you an option to scan your hard drive for music.  Do it.  I only had 4 sample music files in the Windows Media format, and I deleted them from the PC hard drive as allowed from the m-trip software.  You should also register the product as you install the software.  Olympus ships the product with version 1.0 of the PC software and the M:Robe also has the lowest level of firmware installed.  You want the latest updates, so....  Open Internet Explorer and go to the web site: [...]  Uploaded m-trip Music Manager Update v1.06, and m:robe 100 Firmware Update v2.17, and follow the clear instructions they provide to complete these tasks.  The web site provides six different uploads.  You only need the top two, so don't bother with the others.  So now you have the latest software.  Start feeding music CDs into the m-trip software.  It only takes a couple of minutes to upload each CD.  By the time the battery is fully charged, you will have a pretty good collection of music.  Now sync the M:Robe with your PC and you can start playing with this little portable music wonder.   The touch-sensitive controls work easily and smoothly.  It takes some getting used to, but it is all intuitive after a short while.  Play with the equalization settings.  I found they all made the music sound worse, and that no equalization worked best, but you be the judge.  The ear buds supplied with the M:Robe are pretty awful, but hey if you can get this player for net $100 from Radio Shack, that leaves you some extra cash for good ear phones.  Best points of this player:  It looks great with its flat black glass front and bright red control lights.  Olympus did a great job in designing this unit.  Worst points:  The m-trip music management software is not the equal of i-tunes.  For me, who listens to entire albums at a time, this is not an issue.  If you think you can compose a better play list than the original artist, get the i-pod.

[title]:cute, but REALLY fragile
[fullText]:This was the cutest mp3 I found when I was looking around, and also the cheapest, and when I first got it, I was really really happy. However, when I started getting new songs to add, the software screwed me over and deleted all my songs. I had to start from scratch again. Sometimes, it freezes on me, and also, the controls that light up break a lot. Also, the mp3 gets scratched very very easily, and even in a case, it looks like i beat it every night. Maybe I am just not careful enough, but one day, it was near the bottom of my backpack. when i took it out, the screen was cracked in three places, and though i can still use it, I can not read the song name, artist, time, battery life or anything. I am really busy; i don't have time to battle with my mp3 everyday. Over all, the sound quality and design is really good, as well as the over all song capacity and price, but the way it gets scratched so easily and has so many irritating small problems ruined it for me. Only buy this if you are ready to take care of it extremely well, learn the software and read the manual from front to back.

[title]:Sticking with the old version
[fullText]:I purchased the Zen Touch when it first came out with the intention of replacing my old Jukebox Zen.  While I like the looks of the Zen Touch better, I was bothered by a few things. 1) The random button.  I never put my player on hold since I am constantly changing tracks and the volume.  I kept hitting the little random button which put every file onto my playlist.  So then I had to go and delete the files I didn't want only to hit the button again a few minutes later.  Annoying. 2) The playlist feature.  Unlike in the Jukebox Zen the now playing files are not grouped by artist or by album, they're simply placed in one large list.  This makes it very time consuming to delete a particular band from the now playing. 3) Button placement.  I actually like having the buttons on the side of the player (as in the Jukebox Zen), that means that I can easily slip it into my pocket without hitting any buttons. 4) The touch pad.  It's a little difficult to select what you want with this thing but it makes for easy scrolling.  It's also nice that you can set how sensitive it is and you can just tap on it to select songs. 5) The software.  Okay, we all know by now that the software that Creative packages with it's products sucks.  I like their products enough though to deal with it. Overall I thought that the Zen Touch was a good product, I just wish that they had kept some of the features that made me fall in love with the older models.  And until they do I'm going to stick with my Jukebox Zen.

[title]:Third Time's The Charm
[fullText]:I have been using the Zen Touch for several months now. Extremely pleased with my purchase. A couple of years ago I bought a Nomad3, its round shape caused a lot of slipping and falling to the ground. Eventually I had to send it back to Creative to get fixed. An eighty dollar service charge was too much so they sent it back and I managed to fix the unit by dropping it again. Nervous, I sold it to a buddy (it's still working) and bought a Dell DJ15 GB. Made by Creative the unit it self was great but the software (MusicMatch) was very buggy. After discovering AllofMP3.com I ran out of room. So I went back to Creative and loved the new software. Nice unit, very clean looking. The software supports dual players at the same time so it is very easy to swap songs through a PC. Nice feature.

[fullText]:I love this thing.  The Good: Almost everything!  Particularly: EXCELLENT battery life. Solid build. Incredible sound quality. Unique, if not eniterly effective firrmware.  The bad: The included software isn't good.  At all.  But I've used worse.  My 20 GB Zen Touch had a harddisk failure after around a month.  Creative speedily replaced it with another, though on the replacement, the scroll wheel was broken when I received it. They took it back, and somehow I ended up with a 40 GB model.  This is the most excellent and efficient customer service I have ever encountered.  No player I've seen sounds better.

[title]:Very Impressed!
[fullText]:I bought this elsewhere for much cheaper, so do your homework. Amazon prices don't seem as competitive as they once were! Anyway, on with the review. I think this unit sounds fantastic. The headphones really work well for me. They fit my ears well and sound full and robust. I have a pair of Sennheiser ear buds (MX500) and a Sennheiser headset (can't find the model number) and they do not sound as good as the included earbuds. This is a pleasant surprise as I expected the included phones to not fit well and sound poor. So that is good. Earbuds seem to be a very individual thing. In any case, I want to get a new set of headphones, perhaps the Sennheiser PX100s... Overall I find earbuds dainty and difficulty to store well (there is no case for the included earbuds, I use my MX500 case...)  I find the software to be completely usable. I do not use it to rip unless my EAC/LAME setup cannot handle one of my CDs, then the Mediasource software usually handles things just fine, which I find interesting. One thing for sure is that files upload VERY quickly to the player and it is so easy to SYNC your PC music collection to the player (or vice versa). I especially like the media sniffer aspect of Mediasource which scans the directories you point it to for new additions to add to the collection... Very handy!  I would give the player five stars, but: I do wish Creative had included a remote. Also, the case is just crappy and doesn't clamp well to my belt or jeans pocket. I usually put the player in a pocket. Get used to using the player lock button as the random button for some reason seems to get pressed a lot for no reason....   As for the controversial touch strip, I find it to be okay. Yes, it is sensitive, but I find that I am getting better. Initially I was terrible, but incrementally and slowly I am seeing improvement. I turned the tap feature on the touchpad off.  The buttons are useful, except for the random one, which is just plain dumb... No one must have tested this in design phase.  Overall, this is a great player. Comparatively cheap, well designed, and fabulous sound. Works perfectly well for me. I have had it for about 3 weeks now and have been listening and using it a lot!

[fullText]:Great mp3 player with one fatal flaw. All mp3s are stored in one directory, making it very hard to organize songs and resulting in a lot of file name conflicts.  An mp3 player just needs to be a portable hard drive with headphones. Amazing how many lack this basic functionality.  So it's not perfect, but it is better than an ipod. At least it doesn't meddle with my primary music library the way the ipod does.

[fullText]:The Zen Touch is slowly becoming the most important electronic device that I own. My favorite thing is that I can put any MP3 on  the device and it will play it. I have and extensive MP3 collection and it plays them all without fail, from my old MP3's to my newest licensed ones. Throw the bundled software away and just install the newest driver though, I found it very confusing to use. I simply use the drag and drop method to get my music onto the device. I am very pleased with the device and the performance the audio sounds great. It will soon be supported by Napster's To Go service and I can't wait to fill all 40 gigs with music.

[title]:Could be a four-star player if they'd fix the firmware and computer interface software
[fullText]:Positive things: I got my Zen Touch 40GB about a week ago, and overall I'm very happy with it.  The touchpad isn't as easy to use as the iPod's wheel, but if you turn the sensitivity down in the settings it shouldn't be a real problem.  The battery life is exceptional.  I've been skipping tracks like crazy, playing 128kbps-392kbps audio, running my backlight on 30-second mode(the highest), and using 30% contrast.  I charge nightly after use, and I've never yet managed to eat an entire bar off the battery life display.  The sound quality, as others have said, is great.  A clip-on case comes in the box.  It's fine for carrying it around, but if you want to access any of the buttons on the player, you'll have to remove it from the case until you're done messing around.  Negative things: The earbuds that come in the box suck.  They hurt my ears and fall out every three seconds.  Get yourself a pair of these, instead: &lt;A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000092YR6/ref=pd_sbs_e_1/103-8083684-1691818?v=glance&s=electronics">Sony MDR-J10&lt;/A>  The player's firmware is very minimalistic.  You can't set it to display the time of day along with the track information(which isn't something I've seen on any mp3 player, but it would make sense... why should I have to carry an mp3 player AND a watch?), and it doesn't support any lossless encoded audio format.  It also doesn't support viewing text files...  which would be a useful feature for keeping recipies and such.  I'm hoping that Creative will address these three issues in a firmware update.  I've also heard a lot about problems with the player's interface freezing.  I've not personally experienced this, but apparently the only way to fix it is to either wait for the battery to die completely, or push a straightened paper clip into the reset-hole.  You'd think they could make that a little more accessible.  I hope it never becomes a problem for me.  The computer-interface software kind of sucks.  It takes absolutely forever to transfer music to the player, even when using a USB 2.0 port.  The placement of the OK button on the touchpad track was a bad call on the part of Creative's design team.  It's not a huge problem...  it's just not where I'd have put it.  Overall, it's a great player, and I'm happy I got it instead of an iPod, but I'd really appreciate a firmware upgrade.

[title]:money well spent
[fullText]:I've had my Zen Touch for a few days now, and it's been wonderful to use.  All things considered, I fully researched the player before I made the purchase and came to the conclusion that it was exactly what I was looking for.  It has its low points, but the long battery life & low price definitely outweigh its chunky size and lack of subdirectory support.  The High Points: --Sound quality:--  I listen to a lot of classical music in addition to shake-yer-booty club tunes, and the Zen Touch has played everything I've thrown at it clearly, crisply, and without any distortion.   --Price:--  My budget for the player was limited, and I only went a few dollars over while getting lots of bang for the buck. --Data support:--  I have about half the space on my Zen filled with movies and random files which are really easy to drag & drop.  It's great for taking a movie too big for CD over to a friend's place. --Durability&Construction:--  This player feel like quality.  It's obviously well made and sturdy.  It would probably be easy to scratch the finish, but that's why there is a case.  I would definitely be mindful of dropping it while it's running, though, since that's a great way to kill a hard drive.  A fall would likely not harm the case, but if the hard drive is spinning it can ruin the drive. Thankfully, the belt clip has a little edge which helps to keep it from slipping off, and I've clipped it to everything from necklaces to bra straps to a swimsuit with no fear of it falling off. --Battery:-- It just keeps going and going and going!!!  I haven't timed how long I've gotten yet, but it's definitely way over 20hrs.  Docking sucks the life out, though.  Plug in for it.   Things I Expected To Be Low Points But Were Fine: --Scroll Bar:-- A lot of people have complained that it is too sensitive, but mine has been fine to use without playing with any settings.  It took about three minutes of useless flipping from the bottom of my playlist to the top, but it's easy to get the hang of.   --Headphones:--  The included headphones are perfectly adequate.  They're not Sennheisers, but they don't distort and I plan to use them because money is tight and they're fine...  In fact, they're noticeably better than any other headphones provided with CD players I've purchased in the past. --Software:--  I expected that the software would be awful, considering the reviews, but I used both Creative's NOMAD Explorer and Red Chair's NOTMAD Explorer for a while and I didn't feel that it was necessary to pay the extra bucks for it.  Creative's software is perfectly adequate for transferring files to the player, creating playlists, and editing certain ID3 tags in bulk (artist, album, and genre).  That's all I expect it to do, and it does that very well.     The Low Points: --No Subdirectories:--  The Zen Touch uses ID3 tags to organize the files, which is a pain since a lot of the time the tags are wrong, especially on mp3s which have been around for a long time.  However, tags are definitely better on downloaded files these days than they were in the Napster era.  Creative's software makes it easy to bulk edit some tags(album, artist, genre), too, which really helps to cut down on the pain-in-the-butt factor.  Thankfully, there are plenty of free ID3 editing programs out there to easily bulk edit the track number and year fields. --Provided Case:--  Don't get me wrong, it's great protection for the player, but it's not possible to access the buttons while it is in there.  That means everytime you want to change the song, you have to pull the player out, take it off hold, press the next button, turn hold back on, and then slip it back in the case.  What a pain.  I haven't purchased a new case yet, but I'm definitely going to look into it!  And, inconsequentially, the headphone cord is white, so from afar it looks like I'd actually waste my money on an iPod.  Boo.  All in all, this is a great player and definitely worth the money.

[title]:A fine, but abandoned player
[fullText]:This is a fine mp3 player that holds a massive number of files.  The sound quality consistently beats the competition (Creative is, after all an 'audio' company) and the battery life is tops in the industry.  There are a few quirks in the software and user interface but nothing that would take away from the overall usage of the product.  But when paying hundreds of US$ for an mp3 player all of the issues of ownership must be factored in (as opposed to just the player itself).  The problem with this player is that Creative has completely abandoned it.  When it was released in mid-2004, it was billed as a quality alternative to the Ipod (some trade mags and websites were close to crowning it as the Ipod killer).  Yet, more than a year later, there are no accessories of note (Ipod has how many?), and the lack of firmware upgrades (Audio books anyone?) are evidence that Creative has little faith in this product, and more damaging to the possibilities of a future increase in the overall mp3 market share, in developing the consumer loyalties have allowed Ipod to own the market.  Further, given that this product has been on the market for more than a year, not even the most optimistic fan truly believes that Creative will begin, now, to release the needed firmware upgrades (audio books, file management, etc...) or the most desired hardware accessories (car chargers/speaker systems, FM transmitters, high quality sound docking stations - see the Bose product, functionally sound cases, etc...)  Clearly, Creative has moved on to focus on the new mp3 player releases.  To make matters worse, this same player, in essence, is sold through Dell as the 'DJ' with nearly all of the firmware upgrades and a number of quality accessories that Creative has denied to its own direct customers.  No small amount of irony there.  Again, the zen touch excels as a player but minus the support of Creative, and at even the current reduced pricing, it cannot compare to the entire ownership experience to its chief competition.  If you really like this player and don't want to wait until the price drops below $100 (where the 'ownership experience argument begins to be less of a factor in comparison to Creative's competition), buy the Dell version.  If you are looking for an alternative to the Ipod, bite the bullet and buy the Ipod.

[title]:Difficult to use
[fullText]:As others have said, the sound is great and battery life is excellent.  That's about it.   If you (God forbid) hit the "shuffle" button (why do we need a "shuffle" button on the outside where you'll hit it often?) you will "shuffle" until you magically hit the button(s) to correct it - or the Zen gods shine down on you.  I've had this player for several years and still can't figure it out.  Instruction manual?  Forget it.  The touch pad is irritating as you will overshoot your mark often no matter how often you adjust it. There is nothing intuitive about the software.    Here's the best thing.  Sometimes it...just...quits.  You have to get a paperclip, stick it into a little hole and it revives itself.  No idea why it does this.  But rest assured, it will do it at the worst possible moment when there is no paperclip or other similar object in sight.  I bought the Zen because I hate anything Apple.  My next MP3, unfortunately, will be an Ipod.  And the way the Zen has been acting up lately - it might be sooner rather than later.

[title]:Keep all your music with you!
[fullText]:I bought one of these after making extensive comparisons with other players. I didn't want video so I chose this older model. The sound quality is very good with some separately purchased earphones (the ones in the box are okay but not great). The battery life is amazing. I'm not sure if it gets 24 hours but I use it every day all week and I often don't charge it before going back to work again on Monday. I only have two complaints, this player is heavy, but that is to be expected with such a long-lived battery, and that when I am accessing a large playlist the player can take a very long time to respond. Also I find the random button on the front a bit silly, I listen to a lot of different styles of music and hearing opera followed by pop music just doesn't work for me. That said, this is a great player and when the time comes to get a new one I will buy another product from Creative.

[title]:Great sound and storage space. Somewhat annoying interface
[fullText]:I got this to replace my XTRA 30GB. It's pretty much a good substitute.  The sound on this thing is great. Unfortunately the headphone Creative ships with it suck and don't do it justice at all so you will definitely want to invest in a pair of good headphones to go with it.   It's a little smaller than the XTRA and I guess it looks a little better. Unfortunately the little dial  you used to navigate around the menus has been replaced by a touch pad. This takes a while to get used to and still is hard for me to get right on the song I want on first try. Although going into the options and reducing the sensitivity of the touch pad helps with this, Also, there a lot of menus to navigate through. To me new interface is an example of trying to fix something that wasn't broken and actually making it worse. You can transfer music quickly and easily, Vista downloads the right driver instantly and the battery holds a long charge  This is a nice player for about $100 on the whole. The sound is by far the most important thing to me on an MP3 player and the Creative players all sound great. Its 40GB capacity is also nice to backup a lot of music or use it as a little portable hard drive. With all the benefits I can live with the slightly irritating interface and menus.

[title]:Built like a Cadillac, rides like one too!
[fullText]:I have had the pleasure of owning a Zen Touch for the past three years now! The only problem I have had to date is that I lost the power adapter; seriously, that's it!  The Zen Touch has solid construction (I've dropped it several times), is easily navigable, has great sound and has an amazing file capacity. I tried to get into the I-pod hype, but saw so many other cost effective alternatives; I thought I would try to make Mac work harder for my affection (not even the i-phone has swayed me yet).  Although I am a subscriber to Sirius Satellite Radio and make huge use of the Stiletto that boasts a pretty sizable mp3 capacity itself (along with recorded radio files and internet radio capability), I still use my Zen Touch heavily for work at our after school programs.  I would go to bat for the Zen Touch any day (although I don't think Creative makes them any more). I will use my Zen until they start downloading music directly to my brain... we, even then the Zen would probably be way more reliable (I've had to reboot the old noggin quite a few times since I work with kids).

[title]:Some Pros, Some Cons
[fullText]:Have owned it for 2+ years.  Pros:  - Excellent Sound quality - Long Battery Life - Durable, thing can be tossed around and screen has never scratched even with no case to protect it. - Cheap  Cons:  - The buttons slowly stopped doing what they were supposed to. Occassionally hitting "next" will do the dreaded random all. Or it might pause. Could be because of all the dropping over the years but I don't think so. Seemed more of a gradual onset of dysfunction than any "breaking." - Random all is useless and annoying. - The software is buggy. It crashes a lot, and the built in player rarely works. - The touchpad is hard to use, even after years of practice.  Conclusion... Buy it because it's cheap and plays great music for long periods of time. Plus it doesn't need iTunes or the proprietary song format.  If you have more money to spend, however, there is almost certainly something better on the market that is also non-iPod.

[title]:Most enduring mp3 player
[fullText]:I have actually had my Creative Zen Touch for going on five years now, and it still works as flawlessly as the day I bought it. It's a real pity Creative doesn't make them anymore.  I am not gentle with my electronics. I have dropped, washed, left it out in the car, and who knows what else. The (somewhat) cruddy carrying case has long since fallen apart, I've had to purchase new earbuds over and over again as the old ones fall apart, but my Zen is still miraculously going strong.  Although bulky, I find that that larger size is a benefit more than a hindrance. If you drop it, you don't have to freak and wonder if you'll have to shell out another $250+ for a replacement.  Mind you, there are some negative factors as well, most of them applying to the software. I prefer ripping my cds with Windows Media Player, and occasionally I'll rip songs and the software simply won't recognize that there's an mp3 on my computer. I'll open the folder and the software just shows it as empty space. The only way to avoid that problem is by ripping the cd with the software's ripping program, and it's frustrating that you can't change the song quality. Also, I enjoy listening to music from many different countries, and, although when you first set up the software it supports all languages, if you should need to switch computers or download the software to a new computer, there's no longer any language support. You can fiddle with that program as much as you want and download as many patches as you can, it doesn't matter. You'll just have to find the romanized titles for those songs, or the song'll just appear on your mp3 player as gibberish.  Despite these setbacks, the fact remains that the mp3 player itself is sturdy, dependable, and, most imoprtantly, still working. It breaks my heart, but I've been having to look for a new one for no other reason than that I no longer have any room on my old one. And it breaks my heart even more that I can't just get an upgraded version of this one.

[title]:Partially Satisfied Customer
[fullText]:The first day I got my Zen MP3 player, the hard drive immediately stopped working by the second song.  I returned it for a different player and am satisfied with the second player so far.  My only problem with the Zen player is that you cannot create files to store different types of music or certain albums, but I guess you can overcome that issue by playing music according to artist, genre, etc...  Also, I'm still waiting for my refund from e-parts and more for having to ship out my broken player.  It hasn't come yet.

[title]:A note on Benjamin's comment
[fullText]:This is in the response to Benjamin's comment about the ipod encrypting cd's are mp3 you pull into itunes:  hey it doesn't have to "encrypt" the music you store on it. On my ipod i like to mess with the encoding settings to get a bit bettter quality (up to 320kpbs), but you can still go the standard route (192kbs) interchaing the AAC for the MP3 format: (no difference really apple says that AAC is a little better in conserving memory but the difference is too marginal to really matter)  Here's how:  Edit -> Preferences ->  Advanced -> Importing Tab -> Import using Mp3 encoder  That way when you do manage to pull out the music from your ipod using third party software you won't have to worry about the format not being compatible on another player.

[title]:Not worth the money!!!!
[fullText]:I got an iPod mini as a gift from my parents for my birthday almost 2 years ago. I have had to have the  Apple store replace it with a new one twice. The first one that I got wouldn't turn on at all. The second one, the wheel wouldn't stay locked, then it wouldn't hold a charge, and by the time I brought back to the store it was completely spazzing. The third and most recent replacement mini that they gave me had been working fine but as i was using it, all of a sudden the screen faded so now the screen is useless. The people at the Apple store told me that they had never seen this happen before and had no idea why it happened. Its not under warranty anymore and they told me that the only thing I could do  would be to send it to an online repair shop or basically use it as an iPod shuffle. I never dropped any of the iPods, they never got wet, there is no rhyme or reason (even the Mac genius' couldn't figure out why this has happened) for why I have had 3 of them not work. This iPod mini has been nothing but a hassle for the past 2 years, please save yourself the time, effort, and money. I wish someone had warned me.

[fullText]:Complaints are thus:  I have never in my life had any hardware or software give me half the amount of trouble this one product has, and this includes my cartridge blowing Nintendo days.    -Battery has been replaced 3 times under warranty.  Still doesn't work.  -Never got the USB charger to work (the wall adapter to fix this ranges from $30-60, which their tech support will be more than happy to sell you). -Battery never lasted more than 2 hours after two or three uses.   -The potential to "break" your ipod through "improper" software use ensured a few dozen reboots.   -Toss in a heapin' helpin' of branded software like itunes and quicktime that ensure you can never use anything BUT their product.    I don't think I will ever purchase anything from apple again.  If you can avoid them, do.  Their products don't last for poop.

Had to return it and bought the creative zen micro which allows me to put music files into the gadget through windows explorer or windows media player. In addition, it allows data storage as well which ipod mini lacks, and data storage has a maximum of 4gb which I am very impressed. It also came with an extra removable battery and best of all, I can update the firmware myself w/o having to goto Apple personally to update the gadget.

[title]:Uh...Some Suggestions....
[fullText]:I love my ipod mini. I have almost 700 songs on it, and I still have the other half of my cd collection to go thru. I carefully selected which songs to put on here, which saved me some space... Whats the point of putting on songs you wont play?  Also, its user friendly, and iTunes is a snap to use. Granted I had to convert all my wma to aac, it still sounds great! After I finished that, I ripped the remaining cd's straight to iTunes.   A few suggestions....  Dont bother with the EQ. I found it silly to even toy with it. I have a wide range of music on my iPod, so it would be pointless to change the EQ. I listen to my iPod in the car, so if push comes to shove, I'll change the EQ on my car stereo, but I dont find it necessary.   As much as Apple charges for a battery change, save yourself the trouble and go to a local electronics store (Best Buy, Circuit City). They offer extended warranties (mine is 3 year) and will change the battery for you, sometimes free of charge.  Have fun with it!

[title]:traded in my 15GB for this baby
[fullText]:If you read the dimensions, the iPod mini doesn't seem that much smaller than the iPod, but when you hold it in your hand, the mini rules!  I always carried my big iPod in a case because it got scratched so easily, but the mini doesn't need one because the brushed finish doesn't pick up fingerprints.  So big iPod + case >> iPod mini.    I killed my last iPod by dropping it and shattering the LCD screen (ironically on the headphone that had been wrapped around the iPod).  To avoid that with my new mini, I take the included belt clip and clip it to the *front* of the mini, so the LCD is protected.  Included protection!  The only thing that the new iPod mini's don't include is a separate power adapter.

[title]:Great, like it better than my 15gb...
[fullText]:I had a 15GB iPod and also sold it to get this (green version). I have to say, even though it holds less songs, that this is alot better. I erased ALOT of songs i dont listen too, but i dont regret it because they were there for no reason.   The new minis are darker than the older ones. The old mini green was lime green, this ones darker and looks alot better. The case is hard, and doesn't get scratched easy like the big ipod. The click wheel is great, and i like it alot better than the old one. When its in my pant pocket, I can just click the button inside of my pocket without taking it out,(I had the touch 15Gb iPod). The only problem is that the scroll whell isnt as sensative as the other iPod.  The sound seems to be improved alittle. I can turn the volume half way up and it will be as loud as my old iPod at three forths the volume. The battery is also great. I have the backlight on for 2 seconds, and use nice Sennheiser headphones, (Different headphones drain more battery), and listen to the volume at about three fourth, and the battery last about 12 hours. Not bad sinch the last ipod with light and better headphones lasted for about an hour and a half..  The iPod doesn't have that many extras. It has games, nots, clock, calander, and contacts. Other Mp3 players have voice recorders, fm radio, ect. Thats o.k though because they don't have the innovation.  All in all, I suggest you buy this. You won't regret it.

BUT, I am extatically (word invention there) adding album after album on my iPod as I type this.  Yeah, it's kinda annoying to convert WMA files to AAC, but they do the work for you.

[title]:There is an iPod killer out there
[fullText]:I had my ipod for 2 months and everything went wrong...Let me start with the: 1) Battery- u need to buy at least 2 more batteries because the battery completeyl drains to where you can't listen to anything anymore. When that happens, all of that precious music that you spent 2 weeks or 2 months downloading is nonexistent, it deletes everything 2) A 30GB holds 7500 songs...I am a proud owner of the Sony NW-A3000 (20GB) it holds almost 15000 songs, that's right, 15000 songs 3) Trying to get support from apple is like being on life support and someone pulls the plug...enough said 4)Using itunes almost made me break my ipod from all the frustration. Sony uses sonicstage and it can be a royal pain to use, but that software compresses the files which give you more space on your player. A LOT MORE SPACE!!!  My Sony HW-A3000 may not hold videos (Which I never watched on my ipod anyway because I work out) or photos (for the same resason) but I've had it for 4 months and only had to recharge the battery completey 10 TIMES! SONY actually got it right this time There is an ipod killer, it's name is Sony NW-A3000

[title]:Thinking different is cool, Apple iPod is not.
[fullText]:I bought a 30G iPod Photo a little over a year ago and was on my second replacement when just recently, outside the warranty (which of course goes from original purchase date, not replacement date), it's kaput again. Now if I have to pay $275 for Apple to fix or replace a three month old player! No way. THREE players on the blink, each after a few months - that isn't just bad luck.   That isn't even mentioning the difficulties with the iTunes software or if you change computers. I get a new PC and have to re-transfer 100s of CDs! How lame. That negates all the convenience of the large capacity (I wish other MP3 players had the storage space the iPods have).   I just can't justify spending more money to replace this limited, inferior POS again. So essentially over the last year I have spent about $1 a day to have a player and now I'm left with nothing. I will be buying a different player. I will spend far less than $275 and get something that will last more than three months, is compatible with the rest of the players in the world and is easy and convenient to load and use - obviously not an iPod! Unfortunately I can't transfer the music I spend hours and hours loading up (over and over). What a waste of money and time.

[title]:PERFECTION!
[fullText]:As I recieved the 30GB Apple iPod for a gift I was thrilled.  I had been wanting to get one for a long time and finally had one in my hands.  Man, was I excited.  There are many things that make the iPod Photo VERY different from the 20GB iPod and the 60GB iPod Photo.  I will compare the Apple iPod 30GB to each of it's competitors that most buy may buy instead.  Apple iPod Photo 30GB vs. Apple iPod Photo 60GB  You may think: "Wow, 60GB is a lot of memory and it can't be much more bigger than the 30GB, right?" Wrong.  You will NEVER use all of the 60GB unless you have the enourmously large music collection of somewhere in the neighborhood of 15,000 songs.  If you just so happen to have 15,000 songs waiting to be put in an iPod, knock yourself out and go for the 60GB.  7,500 songs is still a great deal of songs, and if each album has 20 songs, then it would fit 375 Albums.  The main thing that comes to mind is that the 30GB is WAY lighter than the 60GB model.  I messed around with my Uncle's 60GB and it was very heavy. It was also very thick, also. When I opened the 30GB, it was as light as a feather, and extremely thin compared to the 60GB.  Also, my Uncle was having all sorts of problems with his 60GB iPod, and I have yet to have one single problem with mine.  Apple iPod Photo 30GB vs. Apple iPod 20GB  There really isnt any contest here.  The overly priced 20GB comes  in black and white while the 30GB comes in color.  Also, you can see the album cover on the 30GB and nothing on the 20GB.  You may not really need the Photo feature, but if you do, the 30GB holds a ton of photos, where the 20GB does not have the capability to store photos.  Basically for only $50 more, you get many excellent features that make the iPod much more fun.  The color screen, photo storing, album cover viewing, 10 more gigs(2,500 more songs), AND more battery life.  The 30GB has a 15 hour battery life while the 20GB only has 12 hours.  If you ask me, that's well worth a 50 Bucks.  Overall, I Highly reccomend the Apple 30GB iPod Photo. I love it and wouldn't change anything about it!

[title]:Undeniably great, MP3s and a photo album too.
[fullText]:I must preface this review with a confession.  I am *NOT* an Apple fan, but I'm slowing beginning to see the merit in many of the Apple products today.  My first computer was an Apple //e, and then I just moved on...  ...Twenty years later, I found myself looking for a birthday gift for The Wife.  I decided to get her something she could use to store the hundreds of pictures we have taken of our son.  I'm a believer of convergence, so I wanted to also put her music collection in the same device.  I immediately looked at Archos, iRiver, and Creative for their solutions.  Each one in turn was compared to the Apple iPod Photo.  Each one fell short.  Some had more storage but less battery life.  Some had difficult UI issues, others had navigation that was less than intuitive.  If the thing was for me, I'd have gone with the Archos for the storage size.  But The Wife doesn't need to be confused or annoyed with UI choices and over-capability.  Simple, direct, useful.  It doesn't hurt that the iPod is stylish, either.  I ordered one, and the optional dock, and the Griffin iTrip.  Took delivery quickly, opened up the well-designed packing, and was suprised at how small the iPod was.  Also, Apple will engrave a few sentences for free if you order directly.  Since this was a gift, that was the route I took.  Some things I didn't like?  Price.  The dock being made optional in this iteration of the iPod.  The lack of a Firewire cable, or AV cables.  Apple should be bundling these items with the iPod; breaking them out to soak customers will likely hurt them later.  If you accept the pricing and grab the optional items, you're in for a treat.  It worked perfectly out of the box.  Install the software, install the dock, dock the iPod.  I had her songs transferred over in less than an hour, her photos of our boy in less than ten minutes.  All 30 gigabytes were filled, too.  Now she has Axe from Brazil, Depeche Mode, and Metallica to get her to work and back; and now she can show off all 600 pictures of The Boy wherever she goes.    And she can finally stop asking me where all the pictures of The Boy are, because they will always be synchronized to the iPod.  And when she wants to hear her music, the iTrip will transmit on any free FM frequency to her car radio, or the kitchen radio, or wherever... and hopefully, she likes her birthday present.  Fred

[title]:Thousands of Songs in Your Pocket! Does it get any better?
[fullText]:If you're like me, you see a new product like the iPod Photo and the techno-lust starts to kick in. The price of the new have-to-have gadget gives you pause, so you read online reviews and start to save your soda cans. Then the day comes. You shell out your hard-earned dollars, and you now have that cool gadget in your hands. Then after a few weeks or months, that had-to-have gadget sits on your desk collecting dust. All the fun was in the wanting, and the product never really lived up to the hype.  Well, let me be the first to tell you... This was not the case with the iPod Photo. I love this thing!  All Your Music - Everywhere You Go: My entire CD collection fits on this thing with plenty of room to spare. Did I mention that this device is smaller than a deck of cards? No more lugging around a handful of CDs wishing that you remembered to grab that other CD on the way into work. Not to mention that with the iPod Photo I can grab the album art from somewhere like say ... Amazon.com, and it displays when I play a track from the CD. You can't do that with the standard iPods as far as I know. The battery life is great. After charging all night, I listen to music on my one hour commute into work, eight hours at work (some days), and then an hour on the way home again. Not even close to running out of power. The sound quality is great, and for headphone listening there's more than enough power to make your ears bleed ... this is a good thing in my opinion.  So if you've never owned an iPod before, what makes this thing so great?  Discover New Music: The iTunes Store offers more than 1 million songs, some of which you may have never heard of for only 99 cents a song, and sometimes even for free. That's FREE as in Beer (and that's always a great thing).  Discover Podcasts: What are podcast? Think of them as talk radio broadcasts that you can listen to whenever you want. There are podcasts on just about any topic you can think of:  sports talk, political opinion, tech-geek news, movie and music reviews, and my favorite "The Dawn and Drew Show" (which defies definition ... think ADHD Seinfeld with an R rating).  Audio Books: Listen to those books you've been meaning to read, but never have the time. One Minute Manager, Seven Habits, etc ...  Carry Your Contact List: Now I've ditched my (dusty) PDA since my contact list was really the main reason I had to carry one. You can upload your entire contact list to your iPod, and phone numbers, email addresses, everything is right there with you.  Photos on your iPod: Aside from the CD cover art, this is not a feature I've played with yet ... what can I say ... I have to sleep sometime.  My advice is buy the 60GB if you can afford it, but my 30GB is not even half full yet. Either way... Give in to your techno-lust and BUY ONE!

[title]:Best MP3 Player By Far
[fullText]:I was holding out on purchasing an apple iPod photo. I didn't want to give into the hype, i was waiting for the perfect mp3 player, but the bottom line is that there is none. I was either going to purchase this or a creative zen touch 40gb. I opted to go with the iPod photo. I'm not a supporter of mac whatsoever, but the iPod impressed me. 30gb is more than ample room for those musid hoarders like myself. Apple says 30 gb of music but 5gb itself is taken up already, due to the awesome programs such as games, contacts, calendars, etc. that apple pre-installed. I'll give my pros and cons below, but overall this is an awesome product, no mp3 player out there is a match. DON'T PURCHASE creative mp3 hd based mp3 players. The hd usually freezes up within 6 months of use even less and you have to send it back to creative for a hd repair, but the customer service is crap to say the least.  Pro: - 3o gb of space plenty of room - album art capabilities - easy user interface in iPod as well as program supplied to transfer music. iTunes   Cons: - although it shows album art the downfall of it is you have to manually upload those album arts. Typically it shows if u have purchased the dl through iTunes, but like me i download music from another source, there are already album art included with the music, but iTunes does not transfer the art into the iPod. You have to purchase a separte program such as iart to make it easier on yourself  - low sound. As compared to the creative i purchased the sound on the iPod is not impressive. You would think with the amount you're paying it would. I suggest getting better earphones which boosts the sound quality   Overall iPod photo 30gb is well worth the money

[title]:(Quite) A Few Quibbles
[fullText]:Well, let me start by saying that this is a very good product. But it is FAR from perfect. I have many complaints, often quite petty (after all, this is my first iPod), but for the $300 or so price tag I expect CLOSE to perfect...   Quibbles:  1. You can't load pictures directly from the camera/memory card onto the iPod. Or, rather, you can't view photos loaded directly. In order to view photos, they must be moved to your computer and loaded through the iPhoto software. This is a MAJOR dissapointment for anyone travelling with their iPod and camera.   2. The (necessary) iTunes software is not compatible with Windows 98 or ME. Devastating to those of us with older computers full of MP3s.   3. The iTunes software is constantly redirecting me to their store. Very obnoxious.   4. I firmly believe that any product that costs me around a week's salary should come with all the necessary accessories. Noticably absent: a carrying case (if you dont want it severely scratched), flash card reader, fire wire, decent headphones, etc. etc. All told, be ready to sink another hundred (or three...) on "fun add-ons".   5. Could they not add some better games?? My cell phone has way better games than this. My TI-83 calculator (yeah, I was a bit of a nerd in high school) had better games than this. What a waste of a color screen...   Complaints aside, the iPod still rocks. The sound quality and design are unsurpassed; the software and database style song sorting are strong - there are clear reasons why the iPod is becoming a cultural icon of the digital age. But, given the price and potential for improvement, I wish I'd waited for a better version.

[title]:Three hard disk failures-definitely buy the extended warranty
[fullText]:I love the Ipod when it works, but I have had three die on me out of the blue.  I have taken care of all of them.  They have not been dropped or exposed to high or low temperatures.  It's easy to get them replaced if you pay extra for Applecare.  That's definitely worth it.  If you have not already invested in getting your music onto Itunes, look closedly at other MP3 players before getting locked into Ipod.  At this point, I have 6000 songs rated on Itunes.  It would take too much time to switch.

[title]:It's about the iPod, stupid...
[fullText]:Just ignore the simpleton from June 12, 2005 who talked about the iPod charger being incompatible with overseas 220v.  Like your laptop, all you need is a cheap adaptor to plug it into the wall socket.  There's absolutely no risk of damaging a US spec iPod if you travel outside the country - I`ve done it plenty of times.  On the other hand, taking your iPod on vacation without your charger is a tad foolish - hardly Apple's fault!  I'm often discouraged to see people who post reviews on Amazon that are more to do with their own shortcomings rather than the product itself.  The 60GB Photo is my 2nd iPod.  Yes it's a little expensive, but I use it daily and find it to be a first rate MP3 player.

[title]:The BEST way to travel with pics and sounds!!
[fullText]:I purchased my iPod Photo for the express reason of taking it to Europe along with my digital camera, my girlfriend has dig cam also. This was our first trip abroad and 14 days in Italy we knew that we would be taking tons of pics and I didn't want to lug around my laptop, so I looked around and decided to get the 60 gig version. Before we left I added over 30 hrs of music, not much for some but more than enough for me. We ended up taking more than 2700 pics over that week and half and the iPod took them all in with no problems. I purchased Apples camera connector, $29? and the world travel adapter kit from Apple also, the travel adaptors allow you to simply change the style of plug that is on the power adaptor that comes with your iPod or your laptop for that matter, the cool thing is you don't need a power converter for your Apple products, just pop off the plug replace it with the one for the part of the world you are going to and you're set. With no problems I was able to plug it in and charge it all over Italy, and download all our pics from both cameras. So instead of having to keep an eye on a big bag with a laptop and worry about it being stolen I was able to keep my camera and my iPod in a fanny pack and I never had a worry. For those of you out there with high end digital cameras and you don't want to pack a laptop this is the way to go, Plenty of space for even large files. As for those folks that find the controls difficult all I can think is that they don't understand simple file formating and higherarchy.  One last thing, you can also use your iPod as an external hard drive to copy and transfer any files you want from one computer to another, and it's drive is big enough for anyone. I couldn't be happier, and like the engraving on the back of my iPod states "Travel is the Best Revenge"

[fullText]:I've used the iPod 60GB as a travel hard drive that I use to store digital images.  I found it to be very fast with the optional fire wire connection cable and very stable--it always works and had no difficulty taking 30 Gigs of images.  It's noiseless, had excellent design features, and is powered through the comptuer--another words 'invisible' when it should be.  I have no hesitation in recommending this product.

[fullText]:Got my Ipod Photo 60GB 1 week ago from [...] Have been playing with it since.I love it. Box contains: - Ipod photo 60, AC Adapter and USB cable for charging/connect. Bought:  -Ipod Case - Belkin Sports Skin($12.54) @ walmart store..cheapest at the best price...other cases with same silicone were ridiculously $29.99 and up...! - Apple Audio-video cable from Apple Store...(other cables dont work, tried it. Bestbuy, Target and CircuitCity had not heard of this cable..can u believe it...Bestbuy said 3 yrs. they have not heard it...take our audio cables instead...no video..anyway!). - Apple camera connector @ Amazon - Car Cassette adapter @ Amazon (later found walmart has it cheaper!) - Griffin Ear Jams @ Amazon...(Apple headphones are useless without this!...you need this!) Hope this helps any one trying to decide on an MP3 player. And oh yes...No other MP3 player comes close to the simplicity and ease of use of Ipod....researched a lot of mp3 players....the only close runner-up was Toshiba Gigabeat....but realized later that an Ipod is after all an Ipod...

[title]:best yet for audible.books
[fullText]:When I was looking for a compatible mp3 player for my audible book downloads, it was months of looking.  I, of course, knew that the ipod could do it, but it was way out of my price range. I bought a rio player, it was not good enuff.  I bought a dell juke box, I LOVED it and still do, but found out that it couldn't do audible books (I have about 300 of them).  Then I got Nomad Zen Xtra. Now that was very nice unit and I liked it,  but I couldn't get very many books stored on it.  After having spent so much money on these devices I thought  "Why not get an ipod?".  So I looked at the selections of ipods and their reviews.  The photo ipod has the least negative reviews and contained lots of storage space. Also on Amazon it was cheaper.  The reviews are correct as to the problems and I have sworn several times at my ipod, but all in all with PATIENCE (sorry lousey in spelling)the ipod works fine. The music sounds good and the books come across great. One of the features I love is that you can speed up the narration without distorting the sound.  I can listen to a 6 hour book in approximately 4 hours for example.  You have to be very gentle with it and be well acquainted with the different menues. It has been a learning experience with me, and continues to be.  Best advice when the device seems dead (blank screen) and nothing revives it hold the "menu" key and center button down for 7 sec or more until apple design shows up. The instructions tell you to do it and you will find it most useful.  To reinterate: 1) best not for young children 2) best not for impatience people 3) excellent for audiophiles 4) design is perfect for holding 5) excellent for walking and running  Blair

[title]:Music Great ... Photos Contacts well sort of
[fullText]:True to its promise it is a great music player and the itunes software is intuitive and makes it easy to create playlists.  The enclosed earbuds are so-so - but it does work as promised, and in my case needed a large chunk of the 60GB though in total between photos and music using about 26GB - so unless you own 500+ cd's 60GB may be more than you need.  The photo bit works as promised but while the screen is sharp the pictures seem a tad fuzzy to me, and while the concept of a slideshow is nice not really using it that much.  Also haven't used the TV slideshow feature which would probably make me like the photo bit more.  I think there is a way to store the whole photo file not just a cut down version - so it becomes sort of a backup.  But I have too many photos to do that for.  I also bought it to store my contacts/calendar - and they make it sound easy.  Well perhaps for MAC users - but for a PC user regardless of my trying to use Palm Desktop or Outlook the contact feature doesn't seem to work and the process is horribly explained - just plain awful.  Also one note of caution - if you are going to carry it around in bag or pocket probably worth getting a cover/case.  Almost immediately I noticed a small scratch on the screen - I was obviously not being careful enough.  Unless you treat with kid gloves - get a cover.

[title]:Very happy with iPod Photo
[fullText]:I selected the 60 GB iPod Photo mainly because I listen to a lot of [...]books. Also, the idea of loading all of my digital photos on a portable device was appealing. The audio books that I had previously downloaded for my Audible Otis player worked fine when loaded onto the iPod using iTunes for Windows. I also love the access to Podcasts from iTunes. Viewing pictures on the iPod screen is not too impressive, but when viewed on my 56" TV they are very bright and sharp. Playing music with the slide show is a nice feature. I found that it is necessary to use Photoshop Album to organize the pictures before downloading on to the iPod. Copying files directly from folders did not work very well since they are all deleted and reloaded any time you make a change. With Album, only the changes are downloaded. The camera adaptor from Apple worked fine with my Panasonic FZ10 camera USB cable. The photos are stored in a file on the iPod disk for copying to your computer. The photos from the camera can be viewed on the iPod screen, but they cannot be displayed on a TV until they are imported from the PC using iTunes. I currently have about 938 songs and 4663 pictures on the iPod using about 8 GB of storage. The only problem I encountered during the initial setup was the requirement to update the system to the Windows format. It was necessary to reboot my computer after this to get iTunes to recognize the iPod. Also, I have noticed that the iPod has reset itself a few times and one time I had to force a reset after it stopped responding. The rewind button does not seem work reliably with the Audible books and it often loses the bookmark when I return to continue listening. Overall, I am very happy with the iPod Photo.

[fullText]:I am actually on my 3rd H10 having had to receive 2 RMA numbers from iRiver.     The number of issues I have w/ this thing is difficult to even tally up.  Generally I wouldn't bother writing a reveiw; however, this morning I find myself having to wipe the piece of cr*p clean for the 30th time and re-syncing several thousand songs once again.  I'm not even going to bother.  I'm just going to go buy a new mp3 player and be done w/ it.  If you buy one of these things after reading this then I can only assume you are a masochist.

[title]:Great first player. Experienced no problems.
[fullText]:While I wasn't ecstatic about receiving an iRiver (I wanted an Ipod), once I started using it I really loved it. It works well with Windows media player, I didn't have to download any software and moving around the menu is extremely easy. I didn't have the charging and battery problems everyone else had, but maybe that's because I read the manual. You don't have to connect to the computer to charge it; you need only connect the mp3 side of the usb cable to your player and THEN connect the ac adapter to player/wall. The only thing I needed to do to my player was update the firmware, which was easy if you can follow directions. Songs aren't always played in order (kind of annoying), but not so much that it ruined my experience with the player. SMART and AFFORDABLE BUY!

[title]:Hands down the best player available
[fullText]:Without a doubt the best player out there. I was blown away by the build quality and attention to detail, iriver really put a lot of work into this. You will wish your cell phone/PDA could even come close to this quality. Took it out of the box, pluged it into usb port and opened explorer (just like a drive letter!), draged mp3s to it, done within 5 min of opening the box. No need to use Windows Medeia Player. A really cool feature lets you record from the FM radio to. By the way the display resolution is 128 x 128 so you can optimize photos (not in the manual or web site). If you are deciding between Ipod and the H10, there is no comparison other than GB, this unit makes the Ipod look like a cheap kids toy.

[title]:REVISED
[fullText]:I love this thing it's way better than any other mp3 player I've used. Here are the specs: FEATURES  * Plays up to 150 hours of digital music* * 5GB of internal storage** * Vivid color display * Ultra-intuitive interface with convenient touch strip * Displays your digital photos * Slim, lightweight design * PlaysForSure enabled to play more of your music * Rechargeable, removable battery lasts up to 12hrs. * Built-in FM tuner and FM recorder * Integrated voice recorder * Ultra-fast USB 2.0 transfers * Supports MP3, WMA, JPEG and TXT files * Enhanced 3D audio (supports SRS WOW  PACKED WITH  * iriver earphones * Carrying case with belt clip * USB 2.0 interface cable * Installation CD * AC adapter  PC SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS  * Windows XP (Service Pack 1 or higher) * CD-ROM Drive * USB Port  It has a great navigation system almost as good as the iPods click wheel.(but that thing is really hard to match) It's features rival that of it's opponents and tops them all. The 3 players I checked out were the iPod mini, the creative zen micro, and of course the H10. I didn't think the Mini was worth $250 when it can't use Napster has no microphone or radio. The Zen micro was my 2nd choice because it has a radio and mic plus it looks way cool with the blue LED in the back and the colors but that is more of a gimmic than a plus and the touch pad doesn't work that well. Then I saw this by accident actually. I downloaded Napster onto my comp and was looking at it's special offers to see what would work with it. I was going to get the zen micro then I finally checked this thing out and I was captured. Since the iRiver H230 looked ugly I never cared abought them but this thing is beautiful and it looks professional. The color screen is a little to small but it looksamazing compared to most LCD screens like the iPod so when you turn it the image isn't negative. It's simplistic button layout is a definate plus which makes it so you don't have to take much time to get used to it. Also it has volume control on the side unlike the zen and iPod. The sorage is fine with me because I don't need my entire music collection with me at all times. However you can't directly link your H10 to a digital camera. Plus it has a few minor bugs. Hopefully iriver will make a firmware update.(mud slinging lol must be a fanboy of iriver) I wish the price was $250 so it could compete with the iPod mini and zen micro easily. But when you make an investment like this you know it's going to work and it does. It also comes with a great iskin which protects it from any fall. This thing is small though I was suprised when I opened it up. Supposedly it weighs less than the iPod mini and it's a photo player!!!  what I said up there ^ is an out of the box reviewwhich you shouldn't trust after only a week of having this machine it is a pain in the @ss. iRiver should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such a premature item with all its bugs. this thing doesn't like a lot of computers and has problems with freezing but worst of all it can't play albums in track order. this is terrible for people like me who listen to bands like green day and linkin park who use transitions in their songs but even then there are pauses inbetween songs. If I bought a camera I'd expect it to work without having to wait a long time for it to be fixed. iRiver has terrible american support which is unacceptable even if they are based in korea. I can't give this thing anything higher than a 3 because it's faults are too big. this had a lot going for it but iRiver being as smart as they are released it way too early

[title]:Disappointment
[fullText]:I ordered the H10 and have now sent it back.  I have had problems similar to those many others listed.  The radio worked great and picked up even distant stations well.  The user interface and size are fantastic.  However, when I loaded music with WMP10, it would not work.  This includes MP3s and WMAs ripped from my own CDs as well as Napster to Go.  I uninstalled and reinstalled WMP10 and got the latest download from Microsoft.  Using this and USB 2.0 on both a Falcon Northwest Pentium 4 3.06 MHz (XP Home) and a Sony Vaio laptop (XP Professional), I had the same problems with both computers and had to conclude that the device was not functional.  The names of the songs jumbled such that artist names were linked to songs of different artists.  The menu and directories were all goofed up.  Many songs loaded but wouldn't play.  Some would play a few times and then everything would jumble up.  Tech support from iRiver was virtually nonexistent.  I sent it back and ordered a Zen Micro today.  I'm hoping I'll have more success.  Overall, the H10 is a very nice device conceptually but it might be better to wait for a later model with more stable technology if you want to order this player.

[fullText]:I got this product about 2 weeks ago.  In spite of hours spent on researching tips from the Misticriver forum and trying all sorts of different ways, the product has not worked correctly.  The playlists do not work, the lists by artists and album is corrupted.  The tech support, which is open only during business hours, has at least 45 minute wait.  They clearly do not have answers to the problems with playlists, etc.  My inquiries via email have been unanswered.  It is clear that the product was prematurely launched to coincide with the Napster to Go campaign.  It is a nice paperweight, if you can afford to spend over $250 for a paperweight!

[fullText]:I have other iRiver products so when I decided I wanted to go with Napster To Go (monthly subscription service that lets you "rent" tracks for compatible players), I knew I would go with iRiver.  The H10 is an elegant little machine -- very nice to look at and solidly built. The interface on the player isn't all that great, occasionally confusing, but it works.  I have had no problems getting music onto the player. It works well with the Napster software. I play albums -- in track order -- by creating playlists in Napster and transfering those playlists onto the player. It's a snap.  And the sound is wonderful. I've been using some pretty good Sony headphones so far and have been satisfied with the sound quality. I have some Shure phones coming soon and expect it to sound even better.  Bottom line. For me the player has been almost flawless.

[title]:Great product, although not perfect
[fullText]:When this mp3 player was first announced and I started to see it all over the net, I was excited. I am a long time iRiver enthusiast (also an anti iPod) and their first micro hard drive mp3 player looked great, with a color screen, and of course tons of other features that iRiver always includes. (By the way, this is where Apple falls short - they dish out the same thing over and over, saying it's a "new generation" iPod with nothing different except the front design. The iPod never has extra features except games, it has terrible battery life, and plus it looks rather uninteresting to me, though not overly ugly.)  Unfortunately for me, when I ordered this iRiver H10 from Amazon (just two weeks ago it cost $271 now it costs 280, I have no clue as to why) they sent the wrong product! I had to return it and order from Newegg. In any case, the red version of this player looks simply amazing. Great sleek design, beautiful color screen, and the red metallic color tops it off. It's a lot lighter than I expected, you have to feel it in your hand for this fact to hit you. The button layout is bot intuitive and comfoprtable.  When I turned this player on my amazement didn't cease. The color screen had better resolution than my color cell phone! The touch pad worked a lot better and easier than Zen Micro's touch pad. I proceeded to plug it into my computer to start downloading music into it. I had no problems with syncing with Windows Media Player, only a slight learning curve. I certainly didn't experience any freezing or crashing problems that many other people mentioned. It might be that they had defective products or their computers are somehow incompatible, though I can't imagine why. After I got some songs into it I listened to the sound quality. Amazing sound. There are thirty or so different preset EQ modes, including an SRS WOW that you can customize, and another Custom EQ. The default EQ is nothing compared to SRS.  So far no problems. The only thing that annoyed me about this player is that it arranges songs in alphabetical order, even if there are numbers in front of them. Let's say you copy a cd into your computer and sync it into the H10. When you rip from cds using WMP, then it automatically puts track numbers into the music files. For example: 01 Foreward 02 Don't Stay 03 Somewhere I Belong etc  When you download it into the player, the numbers are gone and you see the songs arranged in alphabetical order, even when you browse song titles in albums. This can be remedied by changing the titles of the songs like this: 01 songtitle to 01 - songtitle  put a space, a dash, and then another space in between the number and title. Then, go to properties for that song and do the same thing in "Summary" where you input the title, artist, album, etc. Doing this with all the songs should put them in the original album's order. I just found this extremely annoying to do with hundreds of songs, and iRiver should fix this bug.  In any case, I found this player to be out of the ordinary, with great quality sound, beautiful design, and a handful of extra features like text and photo viewing.  And by the way, I know how annoying iRiver support is, with unresponsive service and the like. iRiver orginates from Korea, and the service is a lot better there, along with product quality, and I heard they have no bugs over there. So maybe it's just over here in the US that the problems are occuring.

[title]:iRiver H10 tries, but flunks. Wait for updated drivers
[fullText]:I love iriver products, and was blown away with the sound on this player, but I had UNRESOLVABLE problems with the player and Windows Media 10. I downloaded the "fix" from the iRiver site, but I just couldn't get it to work without re-running the "fix" over and over again. Finally, I returned the player to Best Buy, severely disappointed.  They need to create a new version of iRiver Music Manager as an ALTERNATIVE so one can just drag and drop the songs from your hard drive to the player. The Windows Media 10 is incomprehensible to use; and the connectivity "For Sure" is not sure at all! Furthermore, the documentation doesn't explain HOW to get photos on the player. WM 10 placed them on the file system, but the only way to see them was to use the file "browser" on the H10. Another problem was that the playlists were all "out" of sequenced from the alphabetical order I created on WM10. (This was when I COULD get the WM10 to recognize it). After awhile, I couldn't get WM10 to connect to the H10 at all.  Calls to the tech support line yielded busy signals for 2 days. My email to customer service has yet to be answered.  This has soured me from purchasing iRiver products for some time. Too bad for them.....

[title]:Worst MP3 Player I Have Ever Owned!
[fullText]:Over the last couple years, I have owned a variety of music players. Here is a brief timeline: Rio (64MB) -> Mini Disc (Sony 74 mins) -> iPod (1st Generation 5GB) -> iFP-390T (iRiver 256MB) -> H10 (iRiver 5GB - Present) -> iFP-899 (iRiver 1GB - Present). The H10 is by far the worst player I have ever owned. Here is a list of frustrations that I have experienced during the short time I have owned it:  -Short battery life. I have only made it to about 6-7 hours. Much shorter than the 12 hours listed by the manufacturer.  -Frequent crashes. Much like the only operating system it works with, my H10 has crashed on multiple occasions. So far I have found that the only way to reset the player is to remove the battery. This is made more frustrating when you have the protective skin on, as you have to completely remove it first.  -Slow song changes. It's not very scientific, but it feels like it takes about a second or so to skip to the next song. It makes me think that the buffer is very small. I could be wrong, but believe that the iPod buffers about 20 minutes.  -Poor functionality I. In the morning I like to listen to the radio and switch to music during commercials. With the H10, you have to back out through quite a few screens to get to the radio from the music function.  -Poor functionality II. There does not seem to be any way to create multiple, on-the-fly playlists. You can create one quick playlist and that is it. Has iRiver never seen an iPod?  -Inaccurate battery indicator. This is related to the battery life issue, but is a different problem. On multiple occasions, the indicator has read 100% full for 4 hours, then when I shut it down and turn it back on, it reads 50% full. It will work for about another 2 hours, then completely shutdown due to insufficient battery power.   The H10 has a few other things working against it, but I have listed the ones that bug me on a daily basis. Hopefully, a firmware update will come out soon that will fix some things, but the short battery life is really annoying. Maybe it's so you have to buy additional batteries from them, I don't know.  There is a happy ending to all of this, although it does not involve the H10, but does include iRiver. I missed my iFP-390T and hated the H10 so much that I went out and bought the iRiver iFP-899. The 899 is, without a doubt, the best player I have ever owned (sorry 390T). I'll probably write a review for it, or maybe the 799, which is pretty similar. I love iRiver, but I wish they would put as much care into their hard drive players as they do with their flash players. If you need tons of space and no FM radio, go get an iPod. If you need tons of space and as well as FM radio, go get an iPod mini and use the extra money to buy a good mini radio. The H10 is too little, too late to compete with what is out there. Nothing is innovative about it, and it is more expensive that similar items. Even the Napster To Go service, which only looks good on paper, can't make the H10 worth the price of admission.

[title]:Great 20GB player hampered by poor sftware and documentation
[fullText]:Like many others, when my Rio Karma died and replacements were not available, I ended up shopping around and getting this player. Overall, I am very pleased with the device. It looks great, is easy to use overall, sounds great, and the pictures add to the cool factor. My only two complaints about the device itself would be that you cannot delete tracks directly from the player (you have to use software through your PC) and that scrolling through music only displays title information (not artist/album, like on the Karma). Neither of those are deal killers, but I do miss the features.   My main gripes are with the software support and documentation. The documentation is weak to start with, and not translated well into English. Some of it is indecipherable. Read it through once to get necessary tidbits, then put it aside and play with the device to figure the rest out. As for the software support, I don't like the fact that they bundled it with Napster Lite rather than either something proprietary (that worked better) or better integration with Windows Media Player 10 (WMP10). It is fairly well supported through WMP10, but it's not comprehensive. For example, it synchronizes the software well but doesn't copy or synchronize playlists -- you'll need the Napster software for that (argh!).   I did have one little problem. When I first loaded my library to the device (about 1200 songs), many of them (about 25%?) didn't load with the right genre. That is, the genre in the ID3 tag might be "Reggae" but the device would display it as "(16)." Some would load fine, others wouldn't. This was a problem with both Napster and WMP10, so I don't think it was the player directly. I tried re-entering the genre through WMP10, but it still didn't work. When I used Moosic Organizer to re-write the tags, it worked! I simply re-synced the player with WMP10 after re-entering the tag info and they all loaded just fine.   The photo album is cute, but not terribly useful. The display is large, by mobile device standards, but still small compared to your monitor, or paper pictures. Still, it's fun to have some pictures on the device to share and the display is very good, despite the size.   The device works great as an external hard drive to your PC. You need a special cable to connect the device to a PC (it's not a normal USB cable on the device end), but it functions very well and allows you to use that storage for something other than pictures and music.   Finally, the USB host feature should be very handy for people who have compatible cameras. I haven't gotten my favorite digital camera (a Sony) to work yet, but others seem just fine. I'm sure more support with come down the road.   Overall, a great little device with some nice features. Use WMP10 instead of Napster and you'll be happier. I just hope it holds up better than my Rio Karma did!

[title]:Not A Bad MP3 Player....But Could Use Some Enhancements
[fullText]:I felt compelled to write a review on this MP3 player because it's just getting trashed by the public. I like most people own a Samsung cell phone & think the company produces very good products. I have an iPod & decided to get this MP3 Player because I was getting bored of my iPod. Samsung MP3 Players have been getting the worst reviews on Amazon.Com for its horrible software. Yes! It's true the software provided is horrible only for 1 reason. It's a great program except that once you rip your music from your CD's that it just doesn't transfer over to the player properly (Actually doesn't transfer at all). The program just won't recognize the Samsung player & so in return won't transfer what you just ripped from the CD. I called Samsung at the 1800 number & they said that it's been known to happen with this player that the software just won't recognize the player & that they will contact me in the future when they find a way to fix the bug. So the only way for you to transfer songs over is to use WMP (Windows Media Player). WMP is fine but it does take a tad bit long for the transfer completion & a bit tricky. I feel the Napster software provided is for COMPUTER experts & not for someone like me who just uses the computer to go AOL to chat & check emails. All in all it's not a horrible player, but would be GREAT if the software provided actually works. You can only use the program to RIP music & keep it on your computer as a Jukebox player. I give it 4 stars. I guess I'm being generous.

[title]:Great player, could be better
[fullText]:Great player for a decent price.  Excellent sound quality (and quite loud), great build quality, 8 hour battery life isn't bad, but could be much better.  Navigating the device is fairly straight forward, but unfortunately there are no dedicated buttons for volume adjustment.  The player has a few problems correctly displaying and reading ID3 tag information, and rarely is able to sort an album by track number.  Sometimes tracks are listed alphabetically by title, sometimes by track number, and sometimes it seems randomly listed, perhaps by filename.  The player's database also incorrectly reads the Genre field of the ID3 tags, and usually displays duplicate genres such as one being "Rap" and another being "Rap (15)" - which I could understand, if the tracks were tagged using different software, but I had this happen within one album that somehow got split between the two genres.  Also, be aware that since tracks are stored in a single folder on the device, having a track such as "01 - Artist - Intro.mp3" will prevent a song on a different album, with the same track number and title from the same artist, from transferring to the device at all.   USB host function worked flawlessly with my Canon S230 digital camera (when set from "Normal Transfer" to "P2P/Pictbridge Transfer").  Fairly large 3MP photos that were transferred, loaded quickly into the photo viewer and displayed at a "fit-to-screen" size.  I was, however, very disappointed by the "Album Cover" feature - album cover art cannot be displayed from the "Now Playing" screen, like the Toshiba Gigabeat F-Series & iPod Photo, but instead must be assembled into a slide-show using the provided software, that links the album cover with existing MP3s on the device.  The finished slide-show album is then accessible only from the Photo/Slide-show section of the device, which therefore removes the functionality of sorting albums and skipping tracks within an album.  This feature could have been implemented much better, with tighter integration into the normal audio section of the device, and roughly 50% of the slide-show albums I made wouldn't even play at all.  However, regular photo viewing worked extremely well and photos resized with the provided software looked fairly decent on the small screen.  Other features, such as the EQ worked rather well, but sound quality was better (and louder) with the EQ turned off.  I have not used the MIC and Line-In MP3 encoder, or A-B repeat yet, but it seems that this function might be nice for students that wish to record a lecture, and later transcribe it.  Although the package is clearly labeled "XP Only", the device worked just fine on Windows 2000 Pro (SP4).  The suggested method of song transfer is the included Napster software, which worked just fine once I upgraded to their newest version.  Overall, Napster is a bulky music management solution that is very slow at transferring songs, and requires that you create a free account with the company and be online anytime you wish to use it.  I quickly uninstalled Napster, and now use the non-U.S. version of Samsung's "Music Studio" (not included) which is similar, but more streamlined and works somewhat like Winamp.  Windows Media Player is also suggested for transferring songs, though my 9 series insisted on converting existing MP3s into WMVs before transferring to the device.  The WMVs did play just fine, and I'm assuming XP's 10 series would handle MP3s much better.  Hopefully, once the U.S. 1.0 firmware is released, they may or may not have addressed some of the issues in the devices functionality.  Also, be sure to note, that no carrying case is provided, and currently only Noreve makes a case (though somewhat expensive) that properly fits this particular model.  So while this device is extremely capable of being an excellent DAP, time will tell, if Samsung's upcoming firmware will make use of its potential.  I'd also like to suggest comparing this player to Toshiba's Gigabeat F20 and F21, Samsung's upcoming YH-J70, and Mobiblu's VMP3 DVH-100 (if they are ever released for sale in the United States).

[title]:Don't Do It! You Will Waste Your Money
[fullText]:This product is simply not ready for prime time.  It's an expensive piece hardware that delivers little for the money other than sheer frustration!  The reasons are as follows:  -  In order to transfer music to it you have to sign up with Napster.  What a complete MESS!  Samsung has every right to use proprietary software, but they have a duty to make it workable without requiring a sign up over the Internet with a propritary  seller of songs.  I would NEVER have bought this had I known the extent of the interconnection required to operate basic player features.    -  There are far better players, at far less cost, that simply let you drag and drop your music from the hard drive of your computer to the player without all the excessive work of this Samsung model.  Napster software constantly reported that it needed to stop Windows Media Player when WMP was not running!  I even downloaded the latest version of Napster software - that only made it worse!  When I finally gave up, I did a registry clean-up and there where over 100 corrupt registry entries from Napster and Samsung software.  -  The mass storage device software is very poor.  I have other removeable mass storage devices, from various makers, and they work just fine right out of the box!  This one is more than useless.  It's also slow, slow, slow, slow.  It often takes up to a minute for the system to recognize it, if at all (that happened several times); a system with plenty of memory to spare (over 512 meg of memory), and in excess of 2g speed.  -  The device is so "touchy" that it lost it's file system at least four times and I had to use the provided repair utility to get it to work again.  It took me several times to get the repair utility to work.  -  I have over 2 decades experience with computer hardware and software.  I spent well over 15 hours trying to get this to work properly.  It is not plug-and-play by ANY means.   This device suffers badly from very poor proprietary software that simply fights with the Windows operating system at every step.  Samsung puts out some good products, but this one goes to the very bottom of the pile.

[title]:Napster not required to transfer music
[fullText]:I have had this player for just over two weeks now and have found it easy to use. Unlike what some other reviewers have said, the Napster software is not a must if you want to transfer music to this player. Windows Media Player 10 works just fine. The product manual from Samsung seems to be the cause of the confusion, since it does not do a good job of explaining this. Although the manual gives detailed instructions on how to sign up and use Napster to transfer music, it does not provide any details on how to use WMP 10. You can import your music into WMP 10 and use the Sync feature to upload music into this player - it works just fine.   The player supports Secure WMA and the line-in recording feature is useful to have, if you want to digitize music from your tape and LP collection. I have not yet attempted to import Playlists into the player via WMP 10, though but I have read at least one other review on this site that states that you need the Napster software to import playlists. Assuming this to be a limitation of the product (and not of WMP 10), it still deserves 4 stars, as the sound is excellent and overall, the product appears to be easy to use.

[title]:Samsung Takes On Ipod
[fullText]:About a month ago I bought the ipod 60gig photo with all the accessories; this set me back over five hundred bucks. I bought it because everyone told me it was the best on the market. I must congratulate Apple on making a piece of garbage! Plain and simple. Couple with iTunes and I rest my case. Today I bought the Samsung YH-925GS. I Love it. Clear crisp sound, no distortion at high levels, SRS and WOW capabilities, all of which Apple have omitted from their gadget. Don't believe what the manual that came with the Samsung about having to use Napster to transfer music, you can use Windows Media 10 and Musicmatch, the latter being the simplest! One criticsm. I use, or am trying to use Napster to Go. But right now the unit does not support it and Napster are waiting for a firmware update. Nothing on the box to indicate this, nothing on the website. Apart from that....flawless...buy one!

[title]:It gets the job done
[fullText]:I recently purchase one of these Samsung digital audio players for use on frequent airplane trips.  It has both strong and weak points, the greatest strength being excellent sound, the weakest being the questionable relationship with Napster.  I would concur the those reviewers which made the following observations:  - USB adapter connexion to the cord is a bit tricky, make certain the cord end has been pushed in firmly. - Napster software is quite annoying, and there is no need if you have WMP 10, just synchronize "all music" and you are done. - Napster software requires a continuous internet connexion while in use, which I view as a distasteful personal intrusion. - Playlists are quite a disappointment given none of the WMP playlists may be transferred, thereby leaving only the "mobile playlist" as the sole list. - The sound is superb when used in conjunction with reasonable headphones (I happen to be fortunate enough to have Bose ANR units)  Having researched any number of digital audio players, I would say the Samsung YH-925GS is an excellent one and does not require a PhD to use (once you figure out to avoid Napster and go directly to Windows Media Player).  It DOES have its bothersome quirks, but don't they all.

[title]:Super-great ideas, but ironic quirks aren't worth it
[fullText]:I purchased this model for its unique features, but will be returning it to the store today.  Samsung had some good ideas. > USB hosting > crisp mic recording > Line-in that doesn't require a cradle.  Then they decided to implement a Napster interface. Not intuitive, guys.  You can use Window Media Player 10 instead... but that sucks too. Neither of them make it easy to change track, album, artist, or genre information... THEY WONT EVEN SHOW THE RECORDINGS YOU MADE WITH THE YEPP.  RealPlayer lets you see your recordings, but you can't play them (yet), nor can you modify track info.  To alter track info, you have to export the files to your computer, modify (e.g., right click in My Computer, "Properties"), then send them back to your player via WMP10/Naps***.  Bull$#*^.  The USB hosting only works for a dozen digital cameras (3 or 4 brands), and my Sony cameras aren't on the list. It doesn't seem to work with any other type of USB device either, such as USB flash drives. I understand that if your camera will sinc, you can only download one picture at a time. I want more flexibility than that.  Just think... you're on a trip w/o a laptop, you need to download your pictures to take more... but you can only do it one at a time.  WTF.  After you install a driver, Yepp does work well as an external hard drive.  It provides good volume.  Some distortion was noticed when using equilizer options. Without EQ, quality is just fine.  You can record audio from any source with the Line-In.  All you need is a headphone jack to plug into.  I've recorded comedy stand-up shows from TV and music tracks from movies (you can adjust the incoming volume to whatever you want, thereby undoing the muting they have on DVD's).  It allowed me to pause the recordings so as to get rid of commercial segments.    The mic works very well. You can be on the other side of the room and it will pick up the audio distinctly, even if faint.  It picks up high- and low- range sounds.  I'm impressed. But again, renaming the files is a task.  When you delete the old files, they will continue to show up in your player's listings. You'll end up with a hundred entries of "Voice 00## removed" in your library. It becomes very annoying.  Almost as annoying as it's cumbersome power/USB cord.   This Yepp COULD have been a great product, but the quirks just drive you nuts.  With sadness, I'll now return it to the store.

[title]:Despite compatability issues and poor battery life, excellent
[fullText]:Alright, it's the 21st century now. It's getting to the point where portable CD players are nice...but are so 20th century. I decided I needed a less-bulky and nicer portable audio device. Searching around Best Buy, I came across this. Let me tell you, the iPod is probably the most overrated portable electronics device ever.  Okay, first off by reading the 1-star or 2-star amazon.com reviews, many of them are either unfair or haven't given it a chance/didn't read directions.  Okay, I've heard A LOT about Napster software. For starters, which is a dissappointment, If you don't have Windows XP, go back to the search engine, because it's only compatable with XP. Macs don't count. Maybe, not guarrantee this, but maybe it will work on Windows ME. Not 100% sure, but all stores have a money-back guarantee...right? Also, it's not JUST compatable with Napster. Just because it says Napster on the box and player, does that mean ONLY Napster? No. It's also compatable with Windows Media Player 10, and I've also heard some people got it to work well with RealPlayer. Napster isn't the ONLY software compatable with this player.  For features, it has way more features than the standard, or even photo iPod. First off, yes, it has a built-in digital camera. The pictures aren't crystal clear, but I have a digital camera to do this for me. The pictures are fair to good, but don't get this just for the camera.  What you should get this for is for the wondeful MP3 player/organizer, radio, and MP3 recorder (both line-out and microphone). First off, the menus and organizing is unbelieveable. The menu has a few options, then those options have options, and so on. Example, if you click Music, you have artist, album, genre, song. Then, one you get into the organizer, if you click on a song, it will show up in "Now Playing". It would be better if it had a button to go back to the main menu, but it's only a minor problem. The FM tuner was better than expected and actually better than most portable radios out there. The microphone was also a great feature, and recorded voice very clearly. There is also a line-out to hook up the player to a set of speakers. If you need a car adapter, a lot of electronics stores sell cassette adapters for only about $10. The line-out also lets you record to another audio device. (Example: You can connect the TV to the MP3 player and the player will record the TV.)  The MP3 player holds around 5,000 songs on the MP3 format at around 192 kb/s. Personally, I use 128, so I have about a hundred extra. It depends on how much quality you want out of your tunes. If you want so-so sounding, you'll get more than 5,000, and if you want high quality, it will likely be less. And, it also supports WMA files, so then you'll have far more than 5,000 songs.  The sound quality is excellent. The player features presets for the equalizer, similar to the one in WMP, without the distortation. It also features a 3D equalizer, which many companys (Samsung, Panasonic, RCA) have been doing with their audio products as well. The MP3 player will power most, and about all headphones.  The LCD is in fact proven to be colored, and it is very sharp. It is 1.8 inches, which is equivalent or bigger to the size of an iPod screen. Some players like the Rio Karma have gigantic screens; though, the look is very unappealing. The player also allows you to view your own photos, or the album art. Or, you can look at the headphones, which to me gets hilarious after a few looks.  The biggest dissappointment is battery life. Ten ohurs may seem long, but in reality, not really. Most MP3 players have around 15-20 hours of battery. Though, this isn't much of a gripe for the non-travelers.  Also, the USB 2.0 was nice of Samsung; giving us the best cable link from the MP3 player to the computer.  Overall, unless you don't have Windows XP, and aren't a serious traveler, the YH925GS kicks the iPod in the trash. Well, you would throw away an iPod, right?

[title]:Cool but Quirky
[fullText]:Hardware look and feel is very polished, cooler than ipod, nice form factor and audio recording features not found on ipod.  But software is quirky.  Out of the box had to do a firmware upgrade over the net, and I mistakenly unplugged USB at the wrong time and hosed the drive and had to start over again, though had a similar experience with ipod too.  One major annoyance is though it looks like a drive to Windows when you plug it in to the USB port, if you drag and drop MP3 folders over to it, they are stored but will not be recognized by the player, and wont play.  Only files transferred with the sync from WMP or Napster will play.  This is very annoying if you already have a large collection of MP3 folders and arent too interested in purchasing online right away.  Another annoyance is it will only sync to one PC, if you sync it on a different PC, it may delete all the files!! This kind of fascist copy protection scheme is going too far, imho.  Another major annoyance is the Napster signup, the default is to bill you 9.95 a month!  It wasnt clear to me I had signed up for automatic billing till I got the bill.  Sneaky!  Napster has an 'all-you-can-eat' option for downloading given a fixed monthly subscription, but the fine print says if you ever stop subscribing then all the files you downloaded become unplayable!!  What an amazing 'innovation' that is!! Is this progress?  I think not.  As far as the WMP interface, it works pretty good, though if I edit track genre info on WMP doesnt get updated to device, have to format hard drive and reload all songs apparently, to update new WMP genre changes.   Overall the quirkiness is marginally acceptable, a little more than what I would expect for the third generation or so of this technology, e.g. it still reminds me of the early generation PDA quirks.

[title]:The Perfect Derivative; the Perfect Successor
[fullText]:In concurrence with the previous opinion given by the reviewer from Tuscon, I'd also have to assert that a great deal of the negative reports on the Samsung's quality are products of poor use or sheer dissemblance to the iPod. Make no mistake: the Samsung could still use a bit of improvement in the ease-of-use (mostly with the device itself rather than its music transfer capabilities) and compatablity departments, but it blows iPod out of the water so far as versatility, display quality, and overall attractiveness are concerned.   In terms of display, the Samsung offers a sizeable display along with brilliant color to more-than-accomodate it. However, whether one would find the color display of the Samsung or the color display of the new fourth-generation iPods is - I'd have to say - largely a matter of personal taste (as I own both devices): on the one hand, while the Samsung indeed offers a colorful and playful display, the iPod's new display - while less flashy - is...well, less flashy. In other words, if attractive simplicity is what you'd prefer, then perhaps the iPod is your ticket, but the Samsung still offers more than simply its impressive artwork, or even the per se attractiveness of the actual device.  The photo album/slideshow feature is also innovative and equally attractive, and uploading them in a cinch. In fact, uploading in general - contrary to some reports - is a cinch, though the same can't really be said for managing the device in other respects. The playlists can be somewhat intransigent at times in terms of their organisation.   Of course, one of the greatest stigma for those who find themselves considering whether it is safe to jump off the iPod bandwagon to switch to a PC-grounded or alternative player is the issue of not being able to take advantage of the myriad of accesories that now exist in the market for the iPod and don't yet exist on such a scale for even the most popular of alternative devices. Now if you're looking for an mp3 player that will serve more as portable stereo of sorts or a room-studio hub, then, again, perhaps the iPod is indeed your ticket. But if you're looking for an mp3 player that serves its purpose best as...an mp3 player, than you've found a superior one in the Samsung YH-925.

[title]:A great player at a fantastic price.
[fullText]:I am a bit baffles by some of the negative reviews (Especially the one that said the digital camera in the device sucked. It doesn't have one!). The only negative that I can say about this device is that it is slow to boot up when you turn it on, and slow to shut down. The display is vibrant, intensely colorful, and clear. Volume is easy to adjust and the menu system couldn't be much simpler. I had figured out all the operations and menu system 5 minutes after it came out of the box (without using the manual). Sound quality is sharp and clear, and volume leels are excellent. Transferring songs and photos is a breeze. The unit is sleek and feels good in the hand. The satin aluminum case surrounds a solidly-built device. Overall, I am very pleased with the player.

[title]:A trick for loading music
[fullText]:I've read all the reviews about how inconvenient it is to load music to this player using WMP and Napster. You don't have to go this route though.  This player will function as a drag and drop if you do two simple things. 1: Change the windows settings to show hidden files. Then click on the device and open the music folder in the device. You'll see all the songs you have loaded in there. From there just drag and drop all your new songs right in the folder.  2: After this is done use the utility suite that came with the player to 'rebuild your library'. In doing so, the software will have your device recognize all the music you just dragged and dropped into the player. It's a little easier than syncing.  As for the 4 stars rather than 5, well....as far as I can tell the napster program is the only way to create playlists for the player. This coupled with the lack of accessories and all the searchability issues when you begin to compile quite a bit of music on the player are far from ideal. However, I've owned one since about 3 weeks after it was released and I am very satisfied with it. Never had any problems at all.  Hopefully when they release a general firmware update to it they take some of these issues into consideration.  Also, apparently (though I've never checked it out myself) the Samsung Music Studio program works wonders with this player as well. If anyone has access to this software, I'd love to hear your take on it.

[title]:Battery life shocker!
[fullText]:After only having this mp3 player for a year, I'm ready to throw it in the bin. I could not even sell this piece of junk second hand, as it would be unfair to whoever was suckered into the purchase.  Looks-wise, sound quality and features, this is a top-class mp3 player, but the battery life is the worst I've ever experienced in any item of electronic equipment. Even after carefully nursing the battery to make sure that it was usually charged from completely flat, the player will now only work for about 90 minutes before switching itself off with a low battery warning. Even worse is that it immediately displays the warning and shuts down if you press any off the buttons while the unit is playing under battery power. The only way to make any use of the thing whatsoever, is to leave it permanently set to shuffle all tracks, thereby avoiding touching any of the buttons.  I'm incredibly disappointed in what I had always thought to be a solid, reliable brand. I don't think I'll be buying any other Samsung products in a hurry.

[title]:CRAPPY!!!!!!!
[fullText]:Initially I loved this item. But as time went on the love faded, really fast. After a few months the battery life became less and less. I initially purchsed this to record my lectures, and it did a fantastic job, for a while. Then after a year of having it the internal flash stopped working. This made it completely inoperable because I wasn't able to access the various functions. I called Samsung customer service and they were not helpful at all. This is the last Samsung item I will ever buy. I didn't want to give this thing one star, if I could I would give it negative stars for wasting my time and hard earned money.

[title]:EXCEEDED ALL EXPECTATIONS, BEST IN ITS CLASS
[fullText]:Initially, I was the dumb consumer ready to buy the big brand names like the new Sony NW 507 or a mini-IPOD. But then I decided to do some research and found out that there are other companies out there, like creative rio and samsung that put out even better mp3 players. I did alot of comparing and Samsung's MTX-6 was the clear choice.   I bought a refurbished model from Samsung mall for $86. It came with a 90 day warranty,(fortunately I haven't had to use the warranty, this product is made well) and delivered right on time. For 86 bucks I got 512 gb, FM radio, voice recorder, and a machine that has many functions to produce the sharpest sound. You'll be surprised, how the SRS WOW format on this thing blows I-PODs right out of the water. My brother has a 20 gig I-POD and the sound is much duller. SRSWOW provides a concert hall type sound.   On top of this, the MT6X is incredibly small and cool looking. In the looks department, only sony's nw 507 can compare, the creative muvos look cheap, and those white boxy Ipods will get old real-fast(like everything from the 80's, trust me.) I wear mine around my neck and its very comfortable to jog with.  The best part about the MT6-X is the fact it uses a AA battery, I just use rechargables and I can't tell you how convenient it is.  The 42 hr battery life is no joke, I've literally listened to this thing 2 days straight.   I used to think Samsung put out inferior products since it was a Korean company, but after I bought an LCD display from them, I was  surprisingly pleased, so I gave the MT6-X a chance, its not just a super deal, its the best in its class.

[title]:A wonderful buy.
[fullText]:I had been researching different mp3 players in hopes to find the best one for the lowest price.  The Samsung YP-MT6X is just that.  It's easy to control, and easy to put music onto.  You don't have to change the file type, and it is great for holding other files as well, such as pictures and word documents.  I use mine for just about everything.  I put all my files onto it when I had to reformat my computer and it worked wonders.  The only thing is that I could probably use one with more memory, because I only get about an average of 120 songs each time I load news songs onto it.  And the voice recorded does not work very well, but perhaps that's just me.  One time I did I have some trouble with loading songs onto it, but I just looked in the booklet for possible causes, and did as the book instructed and everything was fine.  I love being able to put a single battery in and having it last me a few weeks or for a long car ride.  All you need is a pack of batteries and you are good for quite some time, and there is no obligation to charge it at all.  And the player is very light weight.  I do keep mine in the protective case, but I wish that it came with an arm band or something of the sort because it's hard to run with the player strung around my neck, but you can just as easily hold it.  I suggest buying this if you are looking at it.

[title]:iPod shuffle?  PUH-LEEZE!!!
[fullText]:Sure, you could get a shuffle...and pay for all the marketing, hype , advertising they do.  What better way to get people to buy a music player with no display (and little to no playback control) than to brainwash people into thinking its "hip."  What's "hip" to me is performance, quality and control...all of which this Samsung unit has.  And THEN some.  For less than $20 more than the worthless Shuffle, you get a DISPLAY (wow!), an FM tuner, better sound quality, and a multitude of menu options including sleep timers, playlists and adjustable EQ's.  It also supports a slew of formats including licensed WMA's and OGG.  The included USB adaptor lets you use the unit as a flash drive.  There's two adaptors included, a standard USB cable and a mini-connector that lets the unit plug right into the USB port (supports 1.1 and 2.0).  The nicest thing is that you dont have to use any proprietary software to transfer files...you can do it through Windows by dragging and dropping; by Windows Media Player, or any other software that allows synching between devices so you dont have to use the painfully slow iTunes program all the time.  The unit runs off of one AA battery for what seems an eternal 40 hours.  Also, it has the abiiltiy to record from a built-in mic, a stereo source (has a mini 1/8" stereo jack) or you can record from the FM tuner.  How freakin cool is that?  The display is clear and easy to read, and navigating through the easily labled menus is a breeze using the little joystick.  This thing is so packed with features that you would wonder why anyone would get anything else for the price.  I cant say enough about how cool this thing is and how well it performs.  If you pass this up for the Shuffle hype you need to have your head examined.  Samsung rocks!!!

[title]:Returned two players.
[fullText]:Had to return two players.  I went to Samsung website to check if there were any firmware updates available for the YP-MT6X player and there were two; one version was 1.101 and the other 2.121.  So, I installed the software provided by Samsung to upgrade the firmware to version 2.121 (downloaded from Samsung website).  I plugged the player and started the update process.  Everything seemed to be ok.  When I unplugged the USB cable the player would no longer turn on.  I had the same exact problem with the second player.  I contacted Samsung customer support, they were of no use; I was told to send the player to them for service.  If you buy this player, DO NOT UPGRADE FIRMWARE to version 2.121 or you will have problems.

[title]:A good mix of form, function, and price.
[fullText]:This player suits my purposes of listening mostly to podcasts to and from work.  As mentioned in other reviews, it connects easily to xp without the Samsung software.  I use media player to sync my podcasts and Windows Explorer to drag and drop music folders.  You could cram about 16 hours of podcasts onto this thing since they are usually recorded at the 64 kbps quality.   After 2 weeks, I'm still at a full 3 bars of battery life - with the single AA battery included - after using the player everyday on my 45 minute commute and playing with the features at night.  It feels great not to be tied to a charger.  For those buying refurbished, make sure that all accesories are included.  There are 2 usb adapters: a cord and a small plug.  The case is not pretty, but it does seem to offer protection.  I have not played with the line in encoder yet.  The player is small enough to tuck on top of my phone while it is in the cell phone pouch of my briefcase.  It works great with my old school tape deck car adapter; there are even specific audio settings for use with speakers, car adapters, etc.  The menu is a little funky, but I have yet to mistakenly advance a song while trying to up the volume.  The screen is clear and I love the option that lets you see how much time is left in a track.       Other reviews posted since I bought the product have really slammed the product for its not supporting the 2.1 firmware.  My player has the 1.1 firmware and I have no intention of attempting to upgrade after hearing those horror stories.  I'm not sure of the benefit of 2.1, but as of right now it does not seem worth the gamble.  I want to note that the Samsung website includes instructions on how to install the firmware.  Written in some pretty rough Konglish, they instruct you to remove the battery when upgrading along with some other specific steps.  I'm not sure whether those installing the the firmware would have followed these instructions or not.  I have also read that the 1 GB version has trouble dealing with a great number of folders, plus 40 or so.  I assume this would hold true of this 512MB version as well.  Personally, I have experienced no bugs.   Since it's my first mp3 player, I resisted the 5 star rating.  That said, I would be surprised if a comparable iriver or Creative impressed me as much as this little player has.  The display-less Shuffle loses on paper alone.  With the tiny Ipod nano (2GB-$200 and 4GB-$250) announced, flash players will probably make some nice advances over the coming months in terms of memory and displays.  At the moment, though, I am loving my $110 Samsung MT6X.

[title]:FIRMWARE UPDATE TO VER 2.121
[fullText]:If you wish to update your player to version 2.121 you MUST FOLLOW INSTRUCTION provided as a pdf file from Samsung. Before the update, you MUST REMOVE THE BATTERY and hold the play/pause button while connecting the player and starting the update software! I had version 1.111 and upgraded to 2.121 in this way with no problems. If you do not follow these direction your player will not turn on as I have found out the hard way. I had contacted Samsung about this problem and although the technical support was of no use when I called, I later saw that the instructions were posted on Samsung website the same day that I called.

[fullText]:I have had the Samsung player for a little while now. I really do like all the features, the screen and the fm player especially. The menu is a little confusing, but I have quickly learned to adjust the volume and songs without looking while jogging, an arm strap may be better than that neck strap. I have not upgraded anything and after reading other reviews I will not try, but I do not know if I'd miss any features.

[title]:Samsung YP-MT6X
[fullText]:I listen to a lot of music on one battery.  I have spent 4 days listening to music all day at work on one AA battery.  The FM tuner is really useful when I want to listen to news or the radio.  The voice recorder comes in handy now and then, plus I can record from the radio or from the output of another device.  I have dropped this several time with no ill effects.  Pros: Great battery life!  Uses AA battery.  Voice recorder, FM tuner, 512MB is actually a lot of music.  Small size.  Great sound.  Seems durable. Cons: Needed to upgrade firmware to make software reliable.  Interface initially not intuitive, but it is easy now that I am used to it.

The user interface is real easy to use. I have yet to read the manual and I have no reason to. The audio quality is nice. The little bud earphones give sufficiant sound quality. I like the image viewer. It could use a couple more cool features to utilize the color screen. More graphics or such. It has a screen saver function and it'd be nice to use a custom image. Audio options are excellent. You can adjust just about anything.   It's small, light weight, very versitle and easy to use. It comes with a good ammount of accessories.  I have nothing really negative to say about this product. It's real good and I'm happy with it except i'd go for the 1 gig @ 200 instead of 512 @ 150.   Cheers! ;D

[title]:Samsung hit the nail right on the head
[fullText]:This mp3 player is perfect for my everyday transit to school of about 1 hour everyday. The bass response and high frequencies are noted very well on the included ear buds. The lanyard and hip clip are well constructed too.  My brother has dealt with his apple, and I do feel sorry for him. He had a 512MB iPod shuffle. It worked fine for a long while until he tried to remove one song and iTunes ended up removing all of the songs. The software is much simpler on the Samsung, because if you are running Windows XP no additional software is needed. All you do is drag from anywhere in your computer and drop into your removable drive folder where the Samsung USB is attatched.  I have dropped it onto cement on several occasions and have found no damage to the case or the storage capabilities. I have also placed text and images and they are easily viewed on the high resolution screen.   And at a price of only $150 its a mini-mini-iPod with built in practicality, or you can think of it as a mass storage USB device with a headphone jack, either way you still get a great working device.

[title]:Beware!  Early release batch defective!
[fullText]:I purchased this unit in late February and within a week it malfunctioned.  The unit turned on with the "locked" displayed eventhough the "Hold" switch was in the OFF position.  I couldn't do anything with it other than turning the unit ON and OFF.  When I called Samsung tech support, it took them less than thirty seconds to diagnose the problem; they already knew about the defect.  My conversation with them gave me the impression there were many returns from the early releases of this unit.  The unit I purchased was manufactured in January 2005.  (For those considering purchasing this unit, note that there's no way to find out the manufacturing date until after you open the package.  The date stamp is on the back of the unit.)  I sent my defective player in for repair and received a refurbished one back.  I was dissappointed at paying so much for a new unit only to end up with a refurbished one.  The other reviewers were lucky to get a working player; I was not so lucky.

[title]:excellent sound and only a few quirks
[fullText]:This player is the first MP3 player that I actually like.  It has a customizable equalizer to get the sound to sound just the way you want it.  Very very few MP3 players let you do that and it is something I believe should be in all MP3 players. The player is small but has a bright color display.  The player doesn't require any additonal software in Windows XP.  You simply drag files between your computer and the player in "My Computer": it is that easy.  There are a few quirks.  The little stick that you use to move around the interface is a little too loose.  You can move it up and the player will think you mived it left or right.  Similarly, manuvering around the interface with the little stick takes a few tries before you figure out how to find the options you want.  But these are minor complaints for such a feature-rich and small mp3 player.  Battery life is OK at max 10 hours.

[title]:I loved it for the 3 hours it worked
[fullText]:A disclaimer:  The sheer gloriousness of this little player earned it the two stars, which is remarkable considering it broke.  I can't imagine how popular this is gonna be if they ever get it right.  This is a gorgeous little player, easy interface, great color screen, rich beautiful sound and works with Windows media player.  HOWEVER, I got the first one this past Saturday, used it for 2 hours....Saturday night it just wouldn't work at all, no matter what I did it wouldn't turn on, I did everything the troubleshooting guide told me to.  So I returned it Sunday morning for a new one.  It worked beautifully Sunday evening...played it for about an hour.  Monday evening, I left the house, got in the car, tried to turn it on..same problem, just refused to turn on no matter what I did.  It's really a shame too, because I just adored it, it was so cute and sounded excellent, and I got photos on it and everything, and it was the size of a zippo lighter.  For 3 hours, I was the envy of my friends.  I returned it Monday for the clunkier but seemingly more solid Zen Micro, and so far so good, but after reading some reviews I'm not too hopeful about that one either.  If this one messes up, I just may scrap the whole idea of ultra-portable music and stick to cd's.  I would suggest you wait two years to buy an mp3 player...wait till they've figured out how to make ones that work right.

[title]:More than the iPod Shuffle (but not so Mac-friendly)
[fullText]:You can read about this great little device's many features in other reviews, so I'll mostly direct this to Mac users.    Apple claims that iTunes supports this mp3 player, but it really doesn't.  You can load mp3's onto it using iTunes on a Mac if you download MuVo Helper, a little freeware application you can find online (search on "muvo helper").  Even with MuVo Helper, however, iTunes can't transfer its playlists to the MuVo; nor can it transfer Audible spoken word files.  Of course, the MuVo won't play Apple iTunes AAC files either--just mp3's.  With a Windows computer (98SE and above), you can upload mp3's and wma's (drag and drop using Windows Explorer, and create playlists by grouping files into folders) and also Audible files (with Audible's Manager program and Creative's new MuVo firmware, which you'll need to download from creativelabs.com).  You might also check out Red Chair Software's Notmad application (redchairsoftware.com), which helps you order songs into playlists.  Otherwise the MuVo can play songs in a few different ways: the order in which you uploaded them, or alphabetical order, or shuffle play.  So... if you have a Mac and no access to a Windows machine, you won't be able to take full advantage of this device.  However, it still makes a worthy alternative to the iPod Shuffle if you don't buy from iTunes: similar price, similar size, removable battery, a pretty good radio with autoscan and presets, and pretty good radio/voice recording as well.  If Creative were to offer a real iTunes plug-in, this would be a little treasure.

It is very easy to use, just plug and play, the person doES not even need a software.... it acts as an external drive.  Moreover, it tops the IPOD shuffle because it has an FM, fm recorder and voice recorder. I read somewhere that this product does not have a shuffle feature. Well, I beg to differ, just go to the play mode and select shuffle once, then it would shuffle all the music folders saved.  With all the assertions above, it is viable to say that this is a great product.....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[title]:I love this thing....
[fullText]:I just got my MuVo TX FM in the mail this afternoon, and it is a delight to use. I was copying MP3's onto the device, and playing them, within 5 minutes of unpacking. I'll also point out that I only have USB 1.0 ports on the system I am using right now, and the transfer speed was still very managable. (About 8 minutes to copy the entire 512 megs, around 1 minute for a single album). As several people say, the earbuds are so so. The belt clip is really nice, and the armband is cool. (Although, as a bigger guy, it might be a little snug if you wanted to wear it on the upper arm.) The display is great with a nice blue backlight, and the interface is very intuitive. The FM reception is great. (It's much easier to let it autoscan and assign all the stations to presets. If you try scanning around on your own without doing this...good luck) The voice recorder works fine, and I have already tried running the output to my car stereo. All you need is a little two ended cable if you have a line-in on your car CD player, and it sounds great. I'm no audiophile, but at least at a casual listen, the sound quality was the same to me as a CD in the player.   The software is OK. You can import an external playlist, and it will transfer a playlist to the player, which is cool. It does seem to take a while to import tracks, and it would be nice if the autoplaylist had a little more control.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the device. I have a couple friends who already owned them, and they are also very happy. Bottom line, why pay the same money for an IPOD shuffle with no display!?!?

[title]:Awesome MP3 Player
[fullText]:I considered many different mp3 players before purchasing this one.  Several things made the Myvo tx fm 512 standout from other similar products.  First was the durability, I am not the most careful person, I have accidently dropped it on a few occasions, including once from the car onto blacktop, but if you look at it you cannot tell that it has ever been dropped.  Next was the storage capacity.  512MB is plenty of storage space.  I have yet to run out of space, I am now up to 38 different bands with about 3 songs apiece.  The price was very good.  Even though the iPod shuffle may be a few dollars left it is a little less reliable and lacks a screen to tell you what song you are on.  Another good feature is the navigation, using windows I made a folder for every band,  it is very easy to move from folder to folder using the small joystick.  I had two slight complaints with this little gizmo.  The first is that the included headphones are very small and uncomfortable.  I replaced the included ones with a pair of my own and and now happy.  The other complaint I have is the included software.  It probably works fine, but I don't have much patience and after a few minutes when I couldn't figure it out I decided to drag and drop and it worked perfectly.

[title]:SUPERB!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
[fullText]:This wonderful tiny unit has it all!  I myself am not an ipod fan.  Yes, they do contain more memory but lack in other areas.  I needed a high quality voice recorder with decent sized memory capacity and this baby fits the bill with extras to boot.  A screen to view text or pictures, FM radio with great reception, time,voice recording and a host of other features which you may need in the future, if not right away. Rechargeable inbuilt battery that can run for 9 hours.  Sure beats having to constantly replace those draining AAA batteries. Its size is fantastic?  Discreet - unlike the somewhat larger ipods, which the same cannot be said about. You can clip this on your trouser loop and no one will be the wiser, and no chance of losing the unit either. I love it and cannot find a fault at this stage.  This lovely audio player is all I will need for some time. I don't know why some US sellers are unhappy about the US price tag.  In Australia the item costs twice as much and I still wouldn't trade it for anything else.

So instead... here are the things which I didn't like about it:  - I found the "joystick" navigation allowed for multiple errors which could've been entirely avoided had Samsung used the standard push-button navigation (assuming it wouldn't drastically change the form factor).  Although infrequent, sometimes when I intended to press straight down on the joystick it'd slip in another direction forcing me to navigate back to the original screen and try again.  - I'd prefer a carrying case that's more protective, especially in covering the screen and corners.  The way it looks, I'm afraid the case will break before the player does.  - The carrying hook is somewhat annoying if you don't use the lanyard since it rattles about (and it's especially evident when recording voice).  It would've been nice if it was slightly depressed within the device with a rubber cover over it, like a smaller version of the one on the bottom.  - Playback while fast forwarding or rewinding should be audible, but instead you don't hear anything.  - The headphones are definitely a disappointment.  My pair distorted slightly at middle volume when I turned on the SRS, Bass Boost, and WOW enhancement options.  (Test music was a 192kbs encoded Elliott Smith mp3.)  Also, retractable earbuds might've been a good idea to continue the theme of small and compact.  - Aluminum/magnesium shell is a bit soft, but it's understandable since it was an obvious choice of style over substance.  I scratched it on Day 1 as I was putting the device into the carrying case (you need to make sure that the initial fit is perfect before sliding it in).  Other than that...  this thing rocks.  :)  Samsung should build a phone around this with all the trimmings.  Even with a slightly larger footprint, I'd buy this to avoid carrying multiple devices around.

[title]:Great features, small unit
[fullText]:I also agree with the other reviews so will not say everything over again either.  I will point out a few things I liked that I didn't see in the other reviews.  *Love the FM record feature.  I set it up to automatically record my XM Radio FM mod signal every night and I have a fresh playlist everyday without having to download songs to it (but that's easy, and I still do occasionally).  *Don't forget this works as portable storage too.  You can create folders and move files with it from computer to computer.  *I liked the belt-clip over the arm band myself.  IMO, it makes it easier to remove and replace.  Plus, I just don't like things straped to my arm.  *Very easy to learn how to use.  Plus, you can play with the other features and most of the time be able to listen to music at the same time.  I figured everything out on my first walk.  *Very complete and well written manual.  I would assume someone in THIS country wrote it.    Tip: The manual suggests using the included software to convert CDs to MP3s, but I found it easier to use Windows Media Player.  Just rip your CDs to the WMP library (which converts them to WMA, and then Sync your library with the player.  Works very well, and this way you only have to use one program.  I didn't really dislike anything about this player, although I don't see much use in the text or image viewer.  The screen is too small and not THAT good to do either well.  The hard drive is a little smaller than a comparable iPod or Zen.  Overall a very good value, especially since it's cheaper than the mini versions of iPod and Zen (at least mine was, after rebate) and have most if not all or more of the features.

[title]:bad experience
[fullText]:well, this was the second mp3 player i bought. the first was a sony  NW-E75 that i bought and it worked great. only reason i decided to buy a new one was because that one only had 256mb of memory and now i was looking for a 1gb player. so i went to circuit city and was looking at the 1gb players. i decided to go with the samsung YP-T7Z over the sony NW-E507 because the samsung looked smaller and more compact. so i bought it, took it home, and wanted to try it out. the first thing that got me was that when i opened it, it said i had to charge it for 2 hours, which seemed odd to me. well i did, and then, i decided to test it out. i plugged in the headphones, and pressed play to hear the 2 default songs already in there. i will say that the sound quality was wonderful and i was impresed. however, when i switched it to the next song, it stopped in the middle of the 2nd song. i thought it was because i acidently pressed play or accidently hit a button, but it had gotten stuck for some reason. i couldnt turn it off or anything. i tried pressing stop several times, nothing. menu, nothing, tried the reset button, nothing. it was just stuck there, the screen still lit up. so needless to say, i was dissapointed, because it would have been the perfect thing to work out with. i took it back to circuit city and just stuck with sony since i already know it. i know its odd to base ones opinion on one defective device, but the sony products i have so far have not caused me any problems.

[title]:i love it
[fullText]:I got the player 3 days ago and so far im loving it. I got the 129.99 refurbrished 1 gig one, and apart for a minor very unnoticeable scratch, it feels and works like new. Im very confident that i will not be using the 90 day manufacture warrenty (ill post again if the player breaks down on me).   As for the player, im totaly in love with it. My first impressions when i saw it and picked it up was how light it is, and not to mention very very small (its easy onto the palm of my hand and i have small hands). I expected it tobe much heavier because it was so small.   It has so many functions for such a little player, it can... view photos, text, record voice - fmradio - and directly for another portable audioplayer with an included audio-in wire, there is VERY powerful(the most powerful fm tuner on a player this size ive ever seen, channels are sooooo clear) STEREO fm radio with 20 presets, i think somone wrote on a review there is no playlist...well there is a playist! the player also has a clock and shows the bitrate of the song that is currently playing( a feature i've never seen on a player before).  I've heard a complain its very hard to see the screen, its not bright enough or too glazed. Its true when you dont press anything screen goes very black and its hard to see the screen, but once you touch the navigation button it lights up brightly. It becomes very visible and readable even with a small screen.   Im not sure about battery life, but i've been using it for 3 days without a recharge and its still on full! I think ive used it for a total of 5 hours. I'm pretty sure it will last you a whole 10 work day.  The player also doubles as a usb storage device, it comes with a very little direct connect usb adapter that turns your player into a thumb drive.   As for the softerware i have not tried it yet, but it does come with software for your music, photos, and text.   The only draw-backs are the earbud headphones are not that great.And the player does not come with a case only a belt clip. The player is sooo cute! i dont wanna get a scratch on it. I hope  a 3rd party makes a case soon.

[fullText]:If you run, & sweat when you run, this unit will NOT hold up. Samsung will tell you it is designed for sport enthusiasts...it is not. This MP3 (1 year) malfunctioned due to 'Water Damage' resulting from perspiration...not caught in the rain, not dropped in the sink. It is not repairable, not honored by the warrantee, and Samsung basically washes it's hands because of their own poor quality casing design. Guess I'll be 'running' to have better luck with an iPod...

[title]:Spend some TIME with it, and fall in love
[fullText]:If you spend some time with this player it is equal to or better then the ipod. I've used an ipod before and its great. But when researching to choose which player I wanted to invest $300 on, I downloaded the manual from each of the players respected manufacturers (apple, sony, iriver, creative). When directly comparing the HD-3 to the ipod (the "most popular player") they both have the same annoying features. Ipod uses only itunes to transfer music and sony uses sonicstage. Sonicstage version 3 was pretty simple to figure out.   I loaded up my library from my pc and then transfered album by album to the hd3. It was the same procedure the ipod manual describes.      The HD3 does have a playlists option in which you bookmark songs. Ipod calls it "on the go something" but both have you hold  a button to add the track to a my favorite playlist which is a few menus away from the opening screen. Its no problem.   Shuffling is also easy to figure out. It's about the same explanation you would see with any sony audio device. I mean the manual came from Japan but its written in english. So stop whinning. The HD3 actually gives you more shuffling options than ipod. You can shuffle all the tracks, or all the albums, or all the artists, or choose to shuffle tracks within an artist or album group.   Overall the HD3 has way better sound and a much longer battery life than any other player including ipod. Plus if the battery dies YOU can replace instead of paying someone to do it. The HD3 is also smaller, sleeker, and looks cooler. Plus when do sony products break? I still use a six year old cd player.  So don't let U2 convince you to buy an ipod. Buy a freaking awesome player that is unique and much cooler.  No I don't work for sony, I work at Publix. Its a grocery store.

[title]:The Sound is Incredible but I had to exchange the original
[fullText]:I bought the Sony HD3 in lieu of the IPOD because of all the reviews I read stating that Sony had the best sound. I was not disapointed with the sound--it's amazing. HOWEVER, I had to exchange it after only four days because the flimsy power button bent when my fingernail accidentally slipped under it. The power button on this device is very thin and should anything get caught underneath it, it will easily bend. This is something Sony should consider modifying with the HD5 that is scheduled to be out this year.   Also: The software is not the best but not as bad as some reviews would lead you to believe.   The best reason to buy this MP3 player: The sound--it's awesome. Also the battery life is a plus but don't count on getting 30 hours unless you convert to the Sony format.

[title]:Buy by name, reap the benefits...
[fullText]:I had purchased the Network Walkman after my iPod was stolen.  I had used the iPod and discovered all of its perks and downfalls.  The Walkman, to me, is 10x as sexy and as functional.  The only downfall is the digital equalizer, which doesn't help the sounds quality whatsoever.  What you need is a good pair of headphones.  The songs go on a lot easier than the iPod's music match and iTunes.  My problem at the moment is finding an FM transmitter as good as the iTrip.  Buy this product, it comes in your favorite color.

[title]:Just a few points
[fullText]:A lot of other reviews have posted all important points, but I'll sum up with the best qualities in this player. All players have flaws in them, but it depends what you are looking for. 1) A 30 hour battery life is great if you play it a lot. Plus you only need to charge it for 2-3 hours to get it fully charged 2) The sound quality is superb for an mp3 player, with its own equalisers, custom and pre-set. You can set your own treble and bass quality. 3) Lots of shuffle options. You can shuffle by groups, singers, albums, and songs (basically track shuffle and unit shuffle). 4) You can't exactly have playlists but you can 'bookmark' up to 100 songs, which acts like a playlist. 5) You can search by artist, groups, genre and album 6) The player is very very small (smaller than an i-pod) and can hold up to 13,000 tracks. It is really thin and can easily slip into a shirt pocket. 7) Lots of useful little things that makes the player great, such as a measure bar to indicate how much time of one song has elapsed.

[title]:Geeky software, not so excellent hardware
[fullText]:Initial review (April 2005) I don't like Apple and neither understand nor want to participate in the iPod mania. My experience with Sony walkmans (I've got two MD walkmans before plus MD hardware) has always been positive, and the choice of NW-HD3 was obvious.  Here are my impressions:  + Sound quality in incredible (I don't have the background noise some people are complaining about); + Navigation is convenient; I'm able to control the device when it's in my pocket; + Native MP3 playback is nice: I've got my previous collection of 300 CDs encoded into MP3 because I couldn't take all of the CDs with me when I moved; NW-HD3 didn't require me to decrease the already decreased quality of the music by converting MP3s into ATRAC.  * The battery lasts for 14-16 hours, not 30 (I'm mostly listening to ATRAC3Plus-encoded music); * The charger is inconvenient but seems to be hard to break :) * The screen is large but long song names get scrolled just once. * Sony's HD-CASE1 hard carrying case became available just recently; it's still hard to find. It's a must if you don't carry your HD3 in your pocket (as I do). * SONY Connect music store is a joke. It doesn't have what I like (various kinds of metal and rock). I downloaded a few songs from it and they seemed to be in ATRAC3 132 kBps - could've been ATRAC3Plus 256 (I didn't find a way to switch the format).  - The software takes getting used to. I tried SonicStage 2.3, 3.0 and 3.1. Upgrade requires you to re-authorize your player (kind of inconvenient). The latest release of SonicStage (3.1) occasinally terminates with some error. - The player sorts music by album name, not by the release year. It's a bit confusing. - The most annoying feature is that the player forgets the song that was played before charging it, and you have to look for it again.  It should be noted that I don't need some features many people find extremely useful: playlists, genres, games, organizers, etc. I know all the albums I record on my player (so far I've put 12 Gigs into it), and thanks to the fast navigation I can access any of them in a matter of seconds.  Buying this walkman was my conscious decision which I didn't regret.  Update after 2006-01-31. The walkman freezes for 20-40 seconds every 3-4 hours, and SONY suggested me to pay them $83 for figuring out what the problem is. Next time I will think twice before buying their harddrive-based gadgets.

[title]:Avoid it and spend your money wisely on some other player.
[fullText]:I baught it and feel like throwing it from the highest floor for the following reasons;  1... Like most MP3 players I have used you cannot drag and drop music files directly to the player.  2... SonicStage Software used to "manage" the file transfers SUCKS. Sony should consider firing its software writing staff, or outsource its software from good people.  3... No songs list. Can only list by Artist /Album/Genre/Group/Others. Dude where my file list?  4... Why on earth do we need another audio format (OMG) ?  5... Did I mention that the software sucks?  Avoid till sony releases a better audio manager.

[title]:Best mp3 player for the price
[fullText]:I have had this player for four months and I am an audiophile and i have had most of the different players for music except minidisk.  THis player is outstading.  Not only does it have unbelievable and unsurpassable sound quality, it also is very functional.  The 13000 song capacity is great however none of us will ever use all that space.  I find that the extra space is nice because you dont have to worry about if u have enough space.  Now to discuss the software.  I have used the orginal sonic stage and found it quite confusing, however the version which ships with the HD3 is superb, most things are tabbed or dropdowns, and very easy to navigate.  If someone thinks the software is hard to use, then they must be completely inexperianced with computers.  I find it uinbebleiavablhy easy to  navigate.  Now this is a real mp3 player, not a fake like the ipod.  The thirty hour battery claim is pretty accurate (honestly  who can use an 8 hour charge?).  This player has much better sound quality and is easier to use.  I did alot of research before buying this expensive peice of equipment (i got it when it just came out).  The specs are much better than anything out there.  You will not regret this purchase

[title]:Network Walkman NW-HD3 - A Mixed Bag
[fullText]:The NW-HD3 looks and sounds excellent.  Navigation via the LCD display is ok but not quite as easy or as quick as on an iPod.    The big drawback is the Sony Sonic Stage software that comes with the unit and that must be used to transfer tracks (there is no alternative).  The software's faults include but are by no-means limited to; can't handle a large number of files (crashes), intermittantly hangs your PC, relies solely on ID3 information (i.e. often transfers files as 'Unknown Artist Unknown Track'), auto-transfer will re-transfer audio files that are already present on your NW-HD3 as additional files (resulting in many copies of the same tracks), has a confusing interface, requires frequent re-installation (which often requires completely re-formatting the NW-HD3), no longer supports importing Windows Media WMA audio files and is very 'processor intensive'.    Software aside, I would give this product 4/5 stars.  With the software I feel generous in awarding it 1/5.

[title]:Worst electronics purchase I've ever made
[fullText]:Absolutely terrible. That's the best two-word description I can give this player.   As many other reviewers on this and other sites have indicated, the SonicStage software is a laughable abomination- as if they outsourced the coding to a group of novice programmers with bad senses of humor. Moreover, if you're lucky enough to get your songs onto the player, the player scrolls through tracks at a mind-numbingly slow pace- for my modest collection (roughy 1k tracks) scrolling took 2-3 seconds per movement. So scrolling through the entire collection in order would take roughly 2-3k seconds, 30-50 minutes. That's simply unacceptable for a device that costs as much as this.  Two notable positives were sound quality and form factor. The device looks and sounds good, and if all you wanted to do was turn it on, press play and let it run, it'd be a great product. But if you like to flip through tracks, my best advice is this- buy something else because it will drive you out of your mind.  Thank goodness for reasonable return policies.

[title]:Do NOT buy this player.
[fullText]:This is one of the worst purchases I've ever made.   While the mp3 player itself is not bad, the software it forces you to use to transfer songs, is aboslutely awful. It will only organize songs by their ID3 tags and sortof artist, album, etc. but the software WILL NOT allow you to create any kind of subdirecty what-so-ever and this drove me insane. If only have 10 albums, fine, if you only have albums made by one artist, fine. But if you have a soundtrack or a compilation album with multiple artists, the whole thing gets split up in alphabetical order according to artist. And if you want to sort by album, every album you have is listed on the main screen. Personally, this way forced me to scroll down for literally minutes to get to an album a ways down the alphabet.  All I wanted to do was organize music so I didn't have to scroll through so much to get to something I actually wanted, but it was literally impossible. And there is no way around this software(SonicStage), I checked with Sony support (I called repeatedly) and everyone I talked to said it is impossible, and judging from how many updates have come along for sonicstage, without this support, I don't see it happening in the future either.  Stay away from this mp3 player, I highly suggest an iPod or an iRiver brand player.

Can search for songs by name of song, album and artist. Also searches by Genres and you can form groups. 6. Can have one playlist that holds 100 songs. 7. Is extremely small and good looking 8.

[title]:Okay if you want to carry around a LOT of songs
[fullText]:When I bought this in the store, I also looked at those little round 1GB players and found those a lot more attractive, but I let myself be talked into buying this one because of the space.  Frankly, 13K songs is WAY more than I'll ever have on this thing; it's kind of like renting an entire condo complex so I can use three or four rooms.  But for those who want a lot of space and want to back up their music collection on it, it's fine.  I have had the same problem people have mentioned about the way the player sorts songs (I have a lot of soundtrack albums by various artists, and when I copied them they were scattered all over heck and gone in the menu) but I found a way around it--SonicStage lets you create personalized playlists, so I simply divide up my music into personalized playlists in My Library and then copy those to the player.  Kind of a pain, but it works.  I also have another issue with the hardware--the power switch on the bottom is rather small and flimsy and difficult to manipulate, and I am afraid it might snap off (probably the day after the warranty runs out).    If I had it to do over again, I would buy a different player.

[title]:Can't Complain...
[fullText]:The best thing about this player is the four way navigation buttons.  If you find wheels and touch-sensitive strips irritating, this is the mp3 player for you.  Simply press the ^ and v buttons to scroll, > to skip or select, &lt; to go back, play to start or stop, menu to change the settings, and mode to switch the browser between artist, album, genre, etc..  The whole thing is very intuitive after just a few minuets of use.      The display is very clear and informative, the exception being that the battery display has only three sections, making it not that usefull.    The whole thing is rock solid yet very light, and the on/off switch is so flat and sunken it will NEVER be turned on by accident.  One time I dropped it and it just hung on the end of the cord without hitting the floor it's so light.    The earbuds that come with it are strangely shaped and hurt my ears so I dont use them.  The so called 'carrying case' is just a felt cover to prevent scratches, not padded or anything(but still nice to have).    The sonicstage software is a bit sluggish, but if you just want to transfer files and use a different program for listening, I think it's fine.    I am confident this thing is going to last a long time beacause i got my sony cd player about five years ago and after much hard usage it still works great.    Also, this thing can playback and charge at the same time so you can plug it in when it gets low on power without skipping a beat.    One of the best things is that if you set playback to random you can shuffle all songs, one artist, one album, one genre, etc. just by selecting it.     Also don't listen to the guy who complained about the scroll speed.  First of all, there is no comprehensive list of individual songs, so there could not even be 3000 items to scroll through.  Secondly, even if there was, the menu is wrap-around so it would only take half that long.  Due to the multiple categories to organize tracks by, it could only take about 30 sec. tops to find the song you want.    Overall the only three petty complaints I have are these: the AC/DC power adapter partially covers the on/off switch, so you can't turn on or off without taking the plug out(a minor annoyance), artists are organized alphabeticly even if they start with 'the', which I know is silly but it gets on my nerves, and thirdly, the shuffle algorithim is a little sketchy and seems to play some songs more than others. But belive me, if you can find a seller, buy it.   P.S. The battery is user-replacable, and you can probably find a new one at Batteries Plus.

[title]:Great Player, Sonicstage is awful...
[fullText]:First, all those people that say it takes for ever to scroll through the music are just wrong.  I have nearly 10k songs on the device and it scrolls through the music faster than an IPOD, which I also own. It is better functionally than the IPOD, although it lacks in add-ons (except for the remote which is far better than anything by Apple). Now the downside.  Sonicstage is just awful.  It is glitchy, the major one being that for no reason it can stop working and nobody at Sony can figure out how to fix it.  The program is very cumbersome, you can configure your music, but it is a royal pain.  Although I am not a big fan of I-Tunes, it is far superior to Sonicstage.  I would buy it over an IPOD for the device is better, but be very leary of the Sony software, it sucks. I think the industry is missing the boat on forcing you to use there interfaces rather than a third party's (i.e. Microsoft's).

[title]:A Great Alternative ToThe Overrated iPod!
[fullText]:A few days ago I finally got my first ever real, full-featured portable music player, a beautiful red Network Walkman and I love it. The thing I like the most is that it ISN'T an iPod (which is for ultra-chic, wannabee-cool-people, music loving lemmings) and it does a good job at what it's supposed to do! Here's a quick bullet-point review:  + Great battery life! + Beautiful red design...neat "sideways" format + Simple and easy to use + Sonic Stage tranfers files fast, does a good quick & dirty job  - No WMA support - Atrac3 encoding necessary for quick transfer of music to player - Compilation CDs have messed up track orders in SS & on the Walkman - Recharging / USB connection is messy and overly complicated - Included Earbuds kill your ears (hard plastic!...ouch!)   Overall, I think this is a B+ product. I gave it five stars because as a music player, it does a great job at that. I see many places for improvement---but since no current music player does everything I want right now, I'll be happy with my Walkman for the next couple years. It's a good 20gb backup drive as well and shopping through [...] (even amid all the controversy of Sony rootkit files, etc.) is very easy, very fast and practically painless.

[fullText]:But the software sonic stage made this by far the worst mp3 player I have ever owned.  I suggest you try iaudio.  I've had 3 of them (sold one, gave the other one away, and kept one for myself).  Easy to upload music, and no headaches like sonicstage.  With Iaudio it took me minutes to upload music.  With sonicstage it took me 3 entire days (with the computer running) to upload the 4,000 songs.  Pathetic.

[title]:buy something else.
[fullText]:I love Sony, i really do. So when i went looking for a mp3, i started with Sony.  In 2005 i bought my hd3 and quickly found it to be lacking. I can't believe in the list of the features it has, "comes with an ac adapter" and "you can connect to your PC".  Why, because for this type of dmp(digital music player) these features should be synonymous.  The problem is there is nothing else.  The one thing I thought would have been included was the ability to make a play-list.   And with out a play-list the "incredible battery life" is about of that when you're changing to a different artist, or albums because you turn on the back-light every time you touch the thing.  I know u can turn it off, but I don't only listen to music when it bright and sunny.  And I'm not going to change it back and forth. My friends have mp3's with Swappable rechargeable lithium-ion battery, multiple play lists, Built-in voice recording and FM tuner with FM recording capability.  Anyway get something else and do some research if your going to spend this much money.

[title]:NW-HD5
[fullText]:I bought the Sony NW-HD5 - about two years ago, because is had 20GB and a rechargable/replaceable battery,  it worked fine for about two years, the the battery failed, for $50 I bought another one, which would't hold a charge, I sent that one back for yet another now it appears that the player failed, because the second battery will not hold a charge.  The player only works now on AC-power.  I replaced it with an Archos 604 with WIFI

[title]:Not bad for the price
[fullText]:I had this for a week and here is what I've found so far:  Pros: 1. Very portable and light. 2. Long battery life. 3. No drivers/software needed (tried on Win 2000 and XP). 4. Reads ID3 (only displays song name on the screen though). 5. Has a voice recorder and it can record from the FM tuner - very cool.  Cons: 1. When the backlight is lit there is a buzzing noise. [Edit: After firmware update the noise disappeared] 2. The screen is very short, but I guess thats the price for portability. 3. Instead of only showing/scrolling songname only they could have shown Artist - Album - Songname. 4. Twice it just paused in the middle of the song (May have been bad mp3 file).

[title]:Good product
[fullText]:I am very impressed with the MuVo N200.  I received it as a gift for my birthday and it has functioned very well for me.  My only qualm is that some of the tracks that I tried ripping from my CDs did not reproduce exactly and skipped in the middle or end of tracks.  I was told that this was the software and that could be updated from the Creative website for a fee.  Other than that, a very good product.  The microphone and FM tuner are cool features.

[title]:Creative MuVo n200
[fullText]:Ups: - Incredibly small (excellent for going to the gym with, or just carrying in your pocket) - Massive storage - Sleek design (and it's shiny! A big plus if you're easily amused like me) - FM tuner and line in (cables included) can be recorded directly to device's memory - Microphone (a nice little feature for recording professor's lectures or anything else you may want to record) - Can also be used as a portable storage device - Music files can be easily organized into folders which can be easily scrolled/skipped/selected on the device's cool blue back lit LCD display and ingenious scrolling wheel - No need to install anything on your computer if you're using XP (and 2000 I hear), simple "drag and drop" interface - Screen can be flipped upside down for left-handed users - Has an equalizer that you can either customize or choose from the one of the 4 presets - Surprisingly good sound, even with the included ear-buds - Short of maybe an ipod (which, might I mention, has no line-in recording, no 15 hour battery life (which is super cheap to replace, unlike the $100 ipod battery), no built in fm tuner, no microphone, and is no where near as small or light as this thing) the best mp3 player out there you can buy.   Downs: - When the backlight is on, there is this really annoying buzzing sound - Songs within a folder cannot be "jumped" to, you have to scroll through the entire list (a price you pay for the player's portability and thus lack of buttons) - The battery cover has this shoddy little plastic nub that holds it in place...I'm constantly afraid of breaking it - This model (512mb model) will be obsolete in a short while (go figure....) because creative is releasing a 1GB version soon (will cost you about 200 bucks), but if you're like me, and can't wait, go ahead and buy this sucker, you wont be disappointed - When you record things using the microphone (I use it to record my o-chem and molecular bio. Lectures sitting about 10-12 feet away from my professors) you have to turn the volume up to max to hear anything during play back (or you can do what I do, transfer it to your computer and use it to amplify the sound). - The ear-buds keep falling out when I'm running - A little pricy, I think closer to 90-100 would have been a fairer price (if u strongly think this too, wait about a month or so, the prices on these things are always dropping) - If you get a dark color (I have the black), be prepared to constantly find your fingerprints all over the plastic case (white looks nice too ;-)) - It comes in a package that is impossible to open, some kind of super-metal/plastic-alloy-crap that you have to use titanium scissors to open (maybe I'm just mad because I cut myself while opening it...but hey, the loss of blood was justified)  On a scale of 1 to 10 - 9.6

[title]:Durable Product, Good Value
[fullText]:I've had this MP3 player for almost 2 years now and it is still going strong. It has worked-out with me and kept me company a lot.  The battery life is good (1 AAA battery lasts long enough for me not to feel like I'm being ripped-off paying for batteries). If you compress the mp3 files (on option provided on this player), then it can hold a couple hundred songs.   The sound is great, and the set-up and process of adding new music is easy.   The only problem is that the player has "frozen" 2 or 3 times on me in the past 2 years. To unfreeze it requires that you go to the Creative website and reinstall the software. It's slightly annoying, but since the problem is fixable without spending any extra money and because it only takes small amount of time, I won't complain.

[title]:512 is more than what you can ask for
[fullText]:it was between this and the mini Yepp player.  no matter how small the other one was the final decision came from having 512 ram.  the player is quite intuitive but switching from player to radio can be a hassle.  i have fairly ok eyes and i don't mind the small screen but it does take certain attention to switch between and i can't do it while driving.  the design itself is pretty good.  comes with a arm strap and a rubber case with a plastic clip that firmly locks onto the strap.  i keep mine in the rubber case cuz serves as a protective item and actually it's easier to grab/use it.  the size of the player is small enough to still hide in my hands even with the rubber case.

[title]:AWESOME player for the money
[fullText]:One of the best player I ever got.  and I went through alot of other mp3 players before: - ipod mini - muvo2 4 gb - ireiver ifp-190t (256 meg) - creative nomad.  etc..  along with all the other stuff, Pros and Cons that other people didnt' mention before: PRO:  - USB cable is standard size (so u can use cable from anyone, instead of paying up the A$$ for expensive proprietory cables) - mp3 encoding and Voice recording is pretty good quality and small size - line-in mp3 encoding offer 96k, 128k, and 160k quality - FM radio has good reception and have have intuitive autoscanning and preset setup - Encodes files are in mp3 format and voice recording is in WAV format. so no need to convert it or load a proprietory program to convert it (that was pis me off about the i-river 190 player) - no software needed.  just plug in and it shows up as a removable drive   CONS: - The Left/Right Rocker is kinda not that that easy to use. I wish they would have swap the Rocker and Volume control buttons. as I use "next/previous track" buttons more - for some reason afew of my songs would miss the first 3-4 seconds of the song. those songs sounded fine in my other players - the wrapper that it comes in be careful when opening, it can cut you :P - when recording from FM radio the record quality is not mp3 quality but WAV like voice recording (but better quality) - the little "bump" near the back for a lanyard is useless because it's too small for any of my lanyard  -  No Playlist feature. it plays from the folders.  not that much of a problem if u have few songs but when u get to 1 gig versions it's a pain to move from song to song since u can't jump.

[title]:Good price and Good Sound but mediocre otherwise
[fullText]:I bought this player because of all the good reviews and it had a built in FM radio, line in recording and it had a drag and drop feature for copying files.  When I got the player I was immediately disappointed because the player though very light was made of very cheap plastic.  Also, the buttons does not seem very sturdy.  The MP3 sound quality is good but the FM radio reception is very poor.  I previously had a Nomad II, which had a much better reception.  The line in recording is very useful but it is of very poor quality and so it is not really worth it.  It is much better to use a computer to encode the MP3 songs.  I am definitely returning mine and my hunt for another player continues.

[title]:Dont See What The Problem Is
[fullText]:I think people are just too hard on the reviews.    If you ask me, I think this is a GREAT deal. It's small, light weight, has a lcd screen, scrolling capabilities, and the sound is GREAT.   People are just stupid when it comes to writing crap. I got mine from wal-mart.  I think it's a GREAT deal.  Now, i'm sure there is much better ones out there.. but for the price this will do me just fine.    I haven't had a problem with it, and the transferring speeds DO NOT take a minute.  I loaded 300 songs in less than 10 minutes.  how fast do you want it? honestly?  The storage capacity is great too, i think they are stretching the 1000 songs u can put on, but even still you can put over 700 on it easily. and you dont need more. If you are looking for that, then u may as well get a ipod as they are made for storage.  It tells you ON THE BOX to use windows media player to sync your songs.. that is what i used and i didn't have a single problem minus one or two songs couldn't convert. but i EASILY fixed that by downloading it again.    The battery life lasts for about 5-6 hours, depending on what your features you have turned on.  for example... if you have the LCD screen on all the time then obviously it is going to drain the battery faster. they say it could last 10 hours, i dont see that, but maybe, if you have the sound turned low, no lcd.. then.... maaaaybe...  Features on this are good, has a bass boost, 5 equalizer presets, the LCD screen is a great feature. And it has a mic built in which works great, if you need to record something than this would work great for it. the mic will pick up even the quiet sounds.  sometimes a bit too much. There is a couple other features that you can look into by reading.  All in all, the product i think is great, i almost wnat to give it a 5 out of 5, but again, im sure there is better ones out there.. but just not at this price.

[title]:i think it's a great deal
[fullText]:i bought it as a factory-refurbished one for only 85 dollars. Overall this mp3 player is great, especially its sound quality.  The sound quality is amazing comparing to my friend's mp3 player.  Also exterior design is nice.  The speed of uploading songs from your computer to the player is average, and it depends how fast and healthy your computer is.  If your computer has too many spywares, surely the tranfer will take a long time.  The earphone comes with the mp3 player is very unique, and the sound quality of the player is only good with the standard earphone.

[title]:Toshiba Gigabeat 10 GB
[fullText]:I think this player works very well.  The sound is great!  It holds songs and photos! You can back up a digital camera to it if you want to get your files off the memory card, but don't have a computer!    I have few minor problems with this.  The first is that there does not seem to be a way to delete pictures from the player; you have to install the Gigabeat Room software and open the photo viewer to delete pictures.  Very cumbersome, and this is not explained in the manual.  The second problem is that when you play in random mode, you cannot "reverse the track" to get any previous track played.  These are the only problems I have, otherwise I think this is a fine player.  You can bookmark, which I assume is for audio books, although I have not done this.  The graphics are wonderful.  I do not regret the decision to buy this player, and I am glad I have it!

[title]:Great MP3 Player, but be careful where you buy online!
[fullText]:I got this unit for my son at Christmas. It is really a nice player, not too large and of sturdy construction.  I would give it five stars, but it does have a few quirks with regard to the software.  The problems are minor though.  It also does not immediately dock and power on when you plug into the dock, another minor annoyance.  Also, the headphones can be rated no more than 3 stars by themselves. Still, for the money offered currently here on Amazon the Gigabeat 10gb represents real value.  I would just caution to make sure you are purchasing from a reputable online dealer. Tiger Direct and their rebate partner BDI Laguna Corporation (ESend) have been sitting on my $50 rebate now (it shows as legitimate on the status site) for close to 4 months. ESend does not respond at all and Tiger Direct while prompt in their responses are truely incapable of helping their customers resolve the problem quickly.  When it comes to rebates, stick with reputable outfits or play it completely safe and just go with the low prices at Amazon.  I know I will not be purchasing from Tiger Direct again.  Fool me once...

[title]:nice for a time.
[fullText]:i have has this player for about two months. its a great player but, the software that it comes with is horrible! and even with windows media player its very hard to load music on. when you are going through the songs  on it you could feel the hardrive move in your hand. its not really a down side but i found it to be surprize. after about a month of music playing. the music on it started to skip horribly! Just like a scratched cd. but on the other hand its very durable. i dropped it about 10 feet.it still works great. (the skipping started way before i dropped it) the only visable damage was a little chip in the corner. there is no accessories. you could try to piggyback some of the ipod accessories. and it always feels like it could just snap in half if you look at it wrong. the picture viewer is nice, but you dont really need it. could use a fm tunner bad! the earbuds that come with  are huge and stick out of of your ears. the 10 gigabites are quite nice to load your whole music collection on. i wouldn't mind the draw backs if it was a little cheaper. i sold my ipod mini for this, thinking that i was getting a great player. i was very dissapointed.   so if your in the market for a mp3 player i would go for a ipod. right now the online apple store has a refrbished mini for $150.

[fullText]:I'm the kind of guy who listens to his MP3 Player constantly.  More than 6 hours a day.  This product is alright and is not really worth the money.   Pros: Pictures and music.  Plays both WMA and MP3.  Nice screen and easy to use. Sound quality is alright  Cons: The Gigaroom(software) sucks and is not as good as Musicmatch and iTunes.  The casing is easily broken.  Can't make playlists on the player.  Can't look at playlist with out going to the main menu.  It's annoying and an iPod or even a Dell Jukebox will be worth more of your money.  Just do your research and be careful what you buy.

[fullText]:This little MP3 player has a lot of power and features for its size!  While there are many brands of MP3 players on the market, I prefer this model of Creative for its compact style and durability.  For half-hour workouts in the gym, it is ideal!  Creative shines with this product, maintaining its reputation for high quality computer sound.  The flash drive has no moving parts, so there is no worry that it will skip or be damaged during an active exercise routine.  I would have given it five stars, but the sound buzzes faintly when the display is illuminated.  While the faint buzzing lasts only a couple of seconds, I would think a company like Creative could do better.  Overall, this player is a good purchase for the money.  I have no regrets!

[title]:Micro MP3 player has Big Sound
[fullText]:This little device is the Swiss Army Knife of Mp3 players. I already own an iPod, but wanted something smaller to carry around and load Mp3 to without the hassle of iTunes. I looked at lots of players including the RCA Lyra and iRiver, but what sold me on the MuVo is the ability to record directly from audio sources like tape decks, Turn Tables and the like. I can just hook up the inlcuded stereo mini plug and convert an LP or cassette into MP3 while listening to it! No need to mess with the computer and Mp3 software.  I have a G4 power mac at home, and this little device works perfectly with it. It just shows up as a Disk Volume when connected to the USB port. I can drag and drop Mp3 files and they play just fine on the MuVo. It's nice to be able to bypass iTunes when you're in a hurry or just need a few files dropped on. Of course you can drop other files like jpegs into the MuVo as well.  I also enjoy the FM radio function. It's nice to have handy if you're stuck somewhere or just need to check traffic or weather. I have not yet used the built-in microphone. Battery life is great, with just one little AAA powering the MuVo. If it dies I can just pop in another one. Unlike the iPod, which you have to charge using a special cable and power outlet or computer firewire port.   This is not a replacement for the iPod, although lately I tend to carry the MuVo more because it's light and convenient. Sound from the MuVo is amazingly good. It's as good as the iPod and even includes a Graphic Equalizer to customize sound. The included headphones are OK, but not very comfortable. At any rate they're easy to replace. The only drawback is the small amount of storage. 256 MB can get eaten up pretty quick....so I find myself deleting stuff a lot. On a per megbyte basis the 20 gig iPod is a better deal, but the MuVo is a great first Mp3 player or even a replacement for a USB flash drive.

[title]:Lives Up To Previous Reviews
[fullText]:As a novice to the mp3 player world I was looking for a device that would fit my criteria for a player that would perform well during workouts:  1)  Consistent, excellent sound;  2)  Non-interfering with workouts.  After reading the reviews on the MuVo Micro N200 I decided to buy the player and put it to the test.  I have been doing cardiovascular workouts for over 25 years and have used the best technology available during those years.  Needless to say, going from portable radios, cassette players, compact disc players and now mp3 player has been a mix of success and failure.  I had become so disappointed in the past that doing without seemed better than the hassle of dealing with faulty players.  Until now.  Without a doubt, the MuVo Micro lives up to the reviews.  Every time I put the headphones on I get clean, clear sound with no skips, hesitations, bobbles, etc.  just pure sound all the time.  I tried using the armband that came with the device as well as clipping it to my shorts.  Both ways work well, my preference being to keep it clipped on.  The only negative I found is something common to alot of reviewers.  The ear buds provided are not the best for active workouts.  I bought a pair of Philips SBC HS500 neckband headphones and they work flawlessly with the mp3 player.  I estimate that the 256 mb holds about 10-12 cds worth of music.  More than plenty needed for an hour workout.  Downloading was essentially drag and drop with no drivers needed with my XP computer.  Overall, I am extremely pleased with this device and have finally achieved something I have been wanting for years; consistent, hassle-free sound.

[title]:Who needs an iPod when you can have a Muvo?
[fullText]:I've been in the market for an MP3 player for some time now, and I've looked at the iPods and considered getting a shuffle, but the Apples are clearly too much hype over nothing.  If Steve Jobs put his vomit into an off-white plastic case and sold it, everyone would still be running to buy it.  I was seriously looking at the iRiver branded MP3 players, but after reading multiple reviews of their inferior build quality and price premium, decided to settle for the Muvo N200 or the Sandisk.  The Sandisk was comparatively too large and bulky, and thus I settled on the Muvo N200.    It offers the most features for a very reasonable price- song shuffling, FM radio, microphone, a LINE-IN jack for recording from an input source, fast USB 2.0 connectivity, a very easy interface (hey, it's just plug and play!), and many attractive colors (I finally settled on orange and white).  I prefer the N200 to the TX series or the upcoming V200s, because the N200s are of the one piece design, rather than have a detachable battery section.  So, a quick glance at the well equipped N200 package.  It comes with a;  - mini-USB to full USB cord - very decent earbuds that come in iPod-white (I found them quite comfortable, even at the gym, and are attractive as well) - a nice soft neoprene like plastic case (with built-in belt clip) that has a side opening allowing easy access to buttons - line input cord  - arm band for working out at the gym  First impressions: I was shocked at how small the N200 is!  It's about the same size and thickness as a cigarette lighter, very unobtrusive, yet very functional.  Construction appears to be robust and well made.  The sound quality is superb, and sounds as good as my Creative sound card, lol.  The volume is easily tunable, and the wheel for scrolling through menus is intuitive and easy.  The LCD screen is backlit in an attractive blue; there is a bit of a buzz when you press buttons as previous reviewers have noted, but I did not find this to be a problem or irritation for me.  Despite the screen being about 1 cm x 2.5 cm, it can surprisingly squeeze a lot of text and images in it, that are easy to read.  256 MB is fine for me, as I mainly need this as a workout player.  I have no problems running with this MP3 player, as the earbuds do stay in my ears.  It uses a single AAA battery rated at 15 hours according to Creative; I haven't been able to test the battery to its maximum potential yet, but at 6 hours so far, the battery life is still on maximum.  Even better, since the plug and play interface is so easy to use, the N200 can also function as a backup USB flash drive for storing those important files!  The radio is fine for a unit this small.  Bass is surprisingly good! and settings can further be tuned with the onboard graphic equalizer.  So in conclusion- no problems so far.  I'm very happy with the purchase, and it's a great little flash based MP3 player for the buck!  Trade in your iPod today!

And you can, if you don't mind listening to... FFFSHSHZZZHSHHHFSHHSZZZZ... and now your probably thinking, "Then why the hell did you give it five stars?" Well, the sound quality of the mp3s is amazing. And the voice recorder is so fun. Which by the way, costs 30-40 dollars for apple to install, and the FM radio is great, and costs 30-40 dollars for apple to install, and you can even record a radio station for songs you like on the radio. I even fell in love with the headpones, their tiny, and very compact, with great sound. Just forget the whole WMA songs. A few people gave this product a bad rating because it only holds 4 hours. Well that should'nt be a major problem at all, because the software is the easiest thing to use since a stand-up shower. Just update it whenever you get bored of the songs. Summed up, this is the smallest, most compact mp3 player (about a third the size of an iPod) with great sound.

[title]:Excellent value
[fullText]:The Toshiba Gigabeat 10GB is an excellent value.  It took a while to get used to the navigation system, but I now find it easy to use.  Accessories are not as easy to find as for some other brands, but I have managed to acquire the important basics such as a car charger and travel charger. I am overall very satisfied with the purchase and would again choose it over other options.

[title]:Nice try
[fullText]:This player has been basiclly pretty good for me. If you plan to download off of CD's it's apiece of cake, but downloading off the net is difficult and dissapointing. This is not all the fault of the player, but partly why ipod has had more success. The photo viewer is nice, but it takes photos off the computer with out asking and I have yet to be able to figure out how to delete them. All in all the player is good bang for the buck.

[title]:Nope
[fullText]:I bought the 60GB version of this MP3 player multiple years ago. and i never use it. why? the interfacing is ridiculous. you cannot easily make playlists on the fly. it is frustrating to get to the music you want to, and half the time i end up settling for some band in the A's or B's, because getting to the L's or T's is such a pain. Another huge annoyance is that artists names such as "the Pietasters" all show up under the T's. I would just turn it into a large equivalent of the Ipod Shuffle (and just have 4 or 5 star songs on it), if getting the Gigabeat to work properly with the computer weren't such a pain.  Previous to this MP3 player i had a 40GB Creative that i used obsessively. I miss it terribly.

[title]:good player for the money
[fullText]:I wanted a nicely priced mp3 player to hook up to the stereo for my business. I have been very happy with the Toshiba Gigabeat. The buttons are easy to maneuver, which is important because different staff use it. When I want to update the playlist I play during business hours, I just bring it home, connect it to my rather slow and dated computer, select the files I want to transfer to the Gigabeat, and then wait awhile. Once I figured out the best way to transfer files via Windows Media Player, transferring files became a snap. I bought a cable to hook up to my stereo receiver, so simple for a non-techie like myself.  If you just need this for music, this is a good capacity mp3 player for the price. I've never had problems with it freezing or malfunctioning. The buttons sometimes seem to either not respond or are very "touchy", but usually they are easy to maneuver. The 40GB capacity is more than ample for my needs, but there are larger capacity models as well. I bought a silicone case for it which is nice because it gets bumped around a lot at work. I also have an FM transmitter in the car which works great with it when we take a rare vacation.

[title]:Colossal Waste Of Time
[fullText]:Did someone say file management?  Race through and install ALL of your image files and convert them into a form that you can do nothing with.  Take your totally useable .mp3 files and turn them into unusable and unmangageable .sat files.  Next, make trying to move these files off and on to the gigabeat to avoid duplicates impossible.  Trying to prepare this unit for sale on Amazon, I found no reference to returning to original factory settings at hand.  Using Windows XP sp2 to format the drive was a mistake.  I hadn't found this out until I sold the unit and was looking for any missing documentation.  It was no use anyway, The unit would bring back things that you've deleted.  The Gigabeat room software would tell you that something is there when unplugged it isn't.  There isn't any Toshiba factory support.  The 1.1 USB is hell-of-slow especially with 2 Gigabytes worth of 700K files.  This unit is generally hostile towards non-commercial music such as my 78s collection on .mp3, my recorded gigs of David Kafinetti (from spinal tap) with bird sounds, train sounds and people I find the need to record.  This thing does not do well with those.  Why do you people always want to see a "Genre".  Sansa was like that also.  What on earth is up with you people?  I will not have my musical tastes pigeonholed.  Thank you not.  Towards the end, it stopped working altogether with the 2.0 USB, Always switched my 1024x768 SVGA to low-res VGA, and slowed all other processes to a crawl while losing track of itself.  A complete and utter failure at filling MY need to put my favorite old 78 records into a form that I can listen to often.  Don't waste your time on this one as it most assuredly will.

The funny thing, when I upload my CD's, so far I only get the CD art when I do it through windows media player cd rip.  I love the sample music and hope that I can figure this thing out to do the same with photos and pic at the same time (instead of starting a song a then menuing out to the photo section).  Need to also figure out how to upload directly from my camera to gigabeat.  So far so good. No tips yet though.

[fullText]:It seems everybody has an Ipod these days.  The Gigabeat looks more stylish and has a better display.  When I ride the train to work in the morning, others look at my Gigabeat with envy (Especially the iPod owners) and ask "what is that thing". The color screen draws attention.  I've found it easy to use with Windows media player 10.  I don't particularly care for the headphones that were packaged with it, but everything else is top quality.

[title]:A bit cheaper but some major flaws
[fullText]:Only tried this player since the iPod isn't compatible with a subscription music service like Napster but you have to live a few major flaws.  1)  Only syncs at USB 1.0 speed with Windows Media Player 10 or Napster's software.  You have to use either of these if you want to listen to copywritten material like Napster's music.  You also have to use the cradle.  Toshiba's software is 2.0 speed and you don't need the cradle to sync but you can't download copywritten music!  2)  Navigation needs some serious improvements.  You can't sort by song title!  And... when playing a song, you can't view other songs on the album without first navigating to ALL artists, then drilling back down to the particular album your currently playing.  Very annoying.   3)  After only one month of use, the player frame is already starting to creek when I push the buttons.  My iPod didn't do that after years of use.    Other than these things, the unit is fine.  The color screen and picture sync is cool and simple to use.  The sound quality is also solid but the earbuds wouldn't even stay in my ear.  But perhaps ears are the problem since iPod buds did almost the same.  I'd look into another brand (e.g. Dell) if you want to use Napster (or comparible) subscription service, though they may have flaws too.

[title]:Playlist Drawbacks
[fullText]:Don't let the size of the HD, the display resolution or, the navigation pad fool you. This product could have been great...but it's just OK. The biggest drawback for me was not haveing a "now playing" playlist. You can't just grab a track here and a track there and add them to a playlist. You can play selected tracks only from a prexisting playlist created from the gigabie software on your PC. The navigation buttons themselves are very cool, I'll admit, but the operation of these buttons in not obvious.  Only after reading through every page of the manual did I understand how to some of the most basic operations [such as returning to the main menu while a track is playing]. I purchased a Dell DJ [20g] a few years back and never had to read a page. The operation was obvious and easy to use. Personally I think it is a decent product, howver if your looking for an alternative to the ipod craze, as I was, you may want to look elsewhere for something with a more simple and obvious operation.

[title]:You get what you pay for
[fullText]:I purchased this Toshiba Gigabeat because it was only about 2/3 of the cost of an iPod.  I saved over $100.  I had a friend who told me about the Dell Jukebox, so I figured this one matched up pretty well.  Well, I didn't research enough.  While the color display on the Gigabeat looks pretty sleek and sexy, the sound quality really isn't all that great.  It's not bad, but not what I was expecting.  I had to go out and get state of the art headphones to make the music sound good.  Forget about the headphones that come with the Gigabeat.  They don't stay in your ears for more than 10 seconds if you're moving around.  Even while laying down, they'll still come loose.  The play list on the Gigabeat REALLY frustrates me.  You can't add and subtract songs from the playlist on the Gigabeat itself, which is insane.  Horrible job on Toshiba's part with that one.  The software is very easy to use and I haven't had a problem with it, as some people have.  My problem was having to load Windows XP onto my computer to use it!  I was using Windows ME, and the program would not load onto it.  That was a hastle in itself, but it was about time I upgraded.  Now, let's talk about this whacky + in the front that you use to control the song selections.  Looks neat, but doesn't work all too well.  I'm also not a fan of the buttons being on the side panel, and only having 2 buttons control about 30 features.  It gets complicated, and annoying.  Many, many flaws with this Gigabeat, but it's cheap, sounds decent, and holds a TON of music.

[title]:The Beat Goes On!
[fullText]:Alright, I'm somewhat crammed with homework, but I just had to give a short mini-review of the lovely Gigabeat. I'm a college student, and at 19 years old, life is pretty hectic, and so tedious walking in-between classes made me want something more. I know a lot about MP3 players, desiring on since uh...probably since I was a junior. An iPod would be nice, but I'm not even close to the definition of rich, so I decided to stick with my CD player. Eventually, I saved up enough to get myself a Christmas present, and so I traded in a 512MB iPod shuffle I got for my birthday for a Gigabeat at Costco. It was the best decision I've ever made. At 249 at Costco, which is the same price for: iPod Nano 4GB or Creative Zen Microphoto 8GB, the Gigabeat trumps those competitors with its massive size of 40GB, although its way larger than a Nano and slightly bigger than a Microphoto. The screen however, is to die for, as its 2.2" and has the same QVGA resolution as the new iPod 5th gen, but with 200,000 more colors. This thing is beggin' for video. I saw the Gigabeat X30, which sadly isn't released in the US, but rather Japan, which costs $311 on some website, is shorter than the 40 and doesn't feature the protrusion on the back of the F40, which is quite weird. I quickly installed the Gigabeat Room, and found that it was very buggy. It froze on multiple times, and it has a few other bugs (I will explain later).  THE PROS AND CONS (Rolled into One) +The screen is amazing. What can I say? However, the sunshine's glare makes it nearly impossible to read anything, and the fonts usually "white" and if you download other QVGA wallpapers, it'll sometimes be unreadable in some spots. The Screen Themes are all cool, making it truly stand out against the iPod. -NO VIDEO! ;( Gah! This thing is crying for video, due to its QVGA display (the same as iPod 5th gen), and its fairly large size of 2.2 (the X30's 2.4 would be even better though). It could be possible through a firmware upgrade, but Toshiba's forgotten about the US (as its already released 3.0 firmware for Japan, and THREE OTHER GIGABEATS, TWO WHO SUCUEED THE F40! The P5 and P10 are their new Japan-only Flash-players, and the F41 (which doesn't feature the protrusion), but looks exactly the same otherwise, and the X30, which I've already talked about.  +Size? This is both a pro and a con, because the new X30 is .57 thick, and the F40 is like .65, I believe. The iPod is only .43 thick, and it weighs only 4.8, while the F40 weighs 5.75 oz. I know that the X30 weighs less than the F40, but I'm not sure by how much, but it probably weighs more than the iPod. The size fits into a pocket perfectly, but it doesn't fit in any iPod case, so you'll have to either: a) find a sock and cut and sew it into the perfect shape (i did that) or b) spend $19, which includes shipping, and by from OneCall (the supplier), a zCover silicone case, which works fine.  +The Player's Shell: The casing is amazingly durable, as I've dropped the player once, from...probably 4'? and it landed smack onto thin carpet and paused for 1 sec before playing again. The shell resists against most scratches. It also feels really good in my hand, and I love the metal as it rubs against my hand.  -The Player's Shell: The metal wrapping that's a darker grey than the rest starts to squeak and very slightly, starts to move back and forth just a little, and I've only had this player for like 2 weeks. Hopefully, this doesn't mean that the player will have future problems.  +Dedicated Volume Button. That's great! +PlusTouch: This is a minor "plus", as you actually have to not just "touch", but you have to apply force. Touching will make it sometimes move and sometimes not. Just push harder.  -PlusTouch: You begin on the first entry in Artist/Album, etc, so you'll have to scroll all over again if you go back. Also, from the top, you can't just hold the up button to go to the bottom of the list, you have to do a quick-tap to move it, then hold it down to move farther up once you reach the bottom. This is extremely aggrivating, since it requires two movements, a tap and a hold to move to the bottom of the list. Also, from the MAIN MENU (if you're playing a song), YOU CAN'T RETURN TO THE NOW PLAYING SCREEN WITHOUT SWIPING YOUR FINGER FROM LEFT TO RIGHT ACROSS THE PLUSTOUCH. PLUS!!THE MANUAL DOESN'T STATE THIS! YOU HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT ON YOUR OWN!! -The Side Controls: Okay, whenever my friends try to use the player, its pretty hard for them to figure it out. I mean, WHAT KIND OF DESIGNER MAKES THE ON/OFF BUTTON RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU FROM THE "Now Playing" section? You can't figure that out without having someone to tell you, or without reading the manual, or without having to try and mess with it to figure it out.  -NO USB 2.0 FOR ANYTHING BUT GIGABEAT ROOM! Toshiba is making you use GR is you want to transfer anything in USB 2.  +Subscription Services. Yay! It works with Yahoo Unlimited To Go, but unfortunately they just raised the prices from 4.99 to 9.99, so dang. +Battery Life: Hmm. This is a tricky category. Well, I've gotten 17 hours, 24 minutes on the first overnight drain, but then, I got 15 hours 45 minutes when I actually used it at school. Toshiba says 16 hours, so I guess this is pretty close. Charging is pretty fast, and you can charge from USB, although you can't play music while charging from USB.  -CHARGING: When you are charging, the volume sudden drops dramatically like 3 steps, although it won't change on the volume screen. Once you unplug, it'll return to normal. The first time this happen to me I was like "Holy crap. These $40 Sony Fontopia in-ear 51's just died on me!", guess I was wrong.  +/-Earbuds: They don't fit my ears, and I couldn't get them to go in, but they fit my brother, so I dunno. It's just about your ear size. I just tossed them aside for my Fontopias, which have amazing quality, although they aren't worth $40, unless you're an audiophile. Normal people, just save your money and go with the stocks, if you wish, as they have okay quality (my brother says this), and they have no hissing, which is great. My brother thought they were great stocks, better than his 4th gen iPod photo, so I gave em over to him.  +Low Priced! You get 40GB for the price of either 4GB flash (iPod nano), or 8GB Microdrive (Creative Z MP), and iPod 5th gen costs 50 bucks more for a .3 bigger screen, less colors, easier navigation, but most of all, 10GB less! 7 (+), 7 (-) THE SOFTWARE Gawd, this software sucks. Both iTunes and WMP10 have their share of faults, but at least they ain't buggy.  +RipREC: This is a great feature, but you can only rip in WMA and in 192kbps, which is why I rarely use it. I use WMP10 to rip in MP3s in 320kbps (double the quality), and then use Gigabeat Room to transfer. The thing transfers directly to the Gigabeat, so if you have a dinky 40GB internal HD like me, you'll love this feature, although I use a flash memory key to store my music temporarily for Gigabeat Room.  -Bug #1: I planned to download "Stripped" to my Gigabeat, and so I did, after ripping it from WMP10 first. I've done it plenty of times, but this time, it made me 20 albums in Album mode, all of them being named "Christina Aguilera". However, if you go to Artists, "Christina Aguilera", it'll only list her "Stripped" album, which isn't anywhere in the Album folders. WTF??? I deleted the 20 songs, but now, you can't delete the 20 "CA" folders. I've tried and tried, even on Windows Explorer, but those folders refuse to be deleted.  -Freeze! Gigabeat Room froze constantly for me, even though I have a 2.2Ghz Toshiba laptop with 512MB memory. It sometimes recovers, but sometimes it will freeze and you'll have to "End Task". This can erase the songs you were trying to download the Gigabeat, although sometimes it won't. I was downloading The All American Rejects, when it froze midway and deleted all the songs that I had already dl'd from the album.  -The software comes up with a message everytimes you turn it on. Annoying.  -You have to go to the Gigabeat's Setup to change whether from WMP10 or GR or Choose When Start Up. The gigabeat was set on WMP10 and the manual doesn't state this clearly, at least, how to change the setting. -TWO MANUALS! WTF? This is a major sign that you'll need a 4th grade reading level. Anyways, the major reading that you'll have to do gives a sign that this player is complex. And it is. If you don't read the manuals, using GR will be difficult, unless you're accustomed to throwing manuals away and learning on your own.  -No firmware upgrade! Japan's already got 3.0 and all we have is 2.02! Why, Toshiba, why?! -The design and layout of the Gigabeat just sucks. It looks ugly, with some of the stuff copied from iTunes (such as the metal brushing look on the top.  +Set to All: Hey it works, and this is VERY GOOD, since in both iTunes and WMP10, you don't have this feature so you must tediously go through individual songs, instead of highlighting like the GR and just using STA.  -SAT. No, not the tests, ladies and gentlemen, although they share a common factor: they both suck. Yes, SAT is added to the end of MP3, making the songs you store on the Gigabeat locked (although you can still delete them Windows Explorer style), you can't play them anywhere else.  -SAT: PART 2: Okay, this part deserve another negative. You can't just store songs on here by draggin and droppin. So therefore, if you were planning to use this player not only to listen to your library, but to store your library (if you have a dinky HD like me 40GBs no less), you're outta luck. SAT prevents this, so if you're against this too, let's protest. However, a firmware would fix this, although, Toshiba has seem to have left us.  2 (+), 7 (-) Conclusion: With bad software, no firmware upgrades (other than 2.0 to 2.02), the Gigabeat is bogged down with those faults. However, the player is pretty good, and is "CHEAP" (listen up if you're on a budget!). This decision is basically up to you, now, although I won't return my Gigabeat, but I'm going to call Tech once I get the time and see if they have a solution to the bugs.

[title]:there are flaws, but it was a gift, so what can you do?
[fullText]:My Dad got me this for X-mas.  Many other people probably found it under the X-mas tree too in 2005.  Only works with XP??? WTF!!!  That pisses me off!!!  Come on, that's just poor for design.  I have ME now and now I have to throw down the dough for the XP.  Whatever. Like I said in the title; it was a gift.  I didn't pay for it.  The software was not designed perfectly, and once I get the XP up and running, I'll probably delete all the files I hastily loaded off my Dad's computer X-mas day because my music files are all over the player and in different folders.  The player is excellent.  The design is excellent.  The sound is excellent.  The picture quality is excellent.  There is no video, no radio, but who cares?  Think about it:  do you really want to watch a show on a tiny screen?  I don't.  That's what I have my tv and portable DVD for....and as for radio, who the hell still listens to AM/FM terrestrial radio?    Lots of people out there don't know anything about these players, so at the gym, people always come up to me and ask me questions.  Girls especially!!:)  The ipod is an ipod and so many people have them now it's almost like their cliche.  Not as cool anymore.  So, when you sport something different, people want to know what it is.  Even though it was a gift I still know the pricepoints and when you get down to brass-tax; dollar for dollar, this player (despite it's flaws here and there) is still enojyable and can't be beat.  Let's face it: no techno-toy we own is perfect.  ....I need Windows XP anyway.  I hate windows ME.

[title]:Pretty good, but could be much better
[fullText]:Pros: Excellent display; large HD; charging while connected to the USB port of a PC; good sound for casual listening; sofware allows bypassing a PC Hard Drive, while transfering from CD.   Cons: No way to load and listen to raw CDA and WAV files or lossless, such as FLAC or APE formats (such a huge HD and you are forced to squeeze your audio files into a highly compressed, very lossy format!) As I mentioned before, sound is good for casual listening, but lacking for a true audiophile. I would gladly pay double the price, if I could just load my music files and enjoy them without converting into all that lossy, double-extension nonsense (.wma.SAT).  The software, Gigabeat Room, is very buggy. It crashes once every hour or so and then resists termination of its process, thus requiring a system reboot. The program permits listening to your files, but you can't preview any image files you may want to load to your Gigabeat.   A couple more drawbacks: no drivers for 64-bit`operating systems. No support, no updates for the Gigabeat Room software, which needs some improvements badly and urgently). The battery is non-replaceable, so when it gets bad, you can kiss your Gigabeat  good-bye.   Conclusion. This is a pretty good product, which can bring a lot of enjoyment, provided you're not looking for a pristine audiphile-quality sound and are willing to suffer some pain of frustrations while loading it up.

[title]:Crippled Functionality
[fullText]:Once again, Sony has designed a great product with incredible functionality only to severely cripple it with over the top digital rights management. I bought this unit to transfer legally purchased mp3 files (that do play on my iPod) only to find out that they "cannot play". Sony tech support indicates that the hardware will not allow mp3's to play if the drm cannot be ascertained - I sent them one of the files and they couldn't figure out why it wouldn't work either. It does do some things exceptionally well, such as play music, has fairly simple controls, great battery life and takes disposable batteries as well as a rudimentary but functional display that lights up to make it easier to see at night. It also holds a lot of songs as Sony indicates in their literature. Unfortunately, it does require that you use the Sony supplied software to transfer songs into it - and the Sonic Stage software is nowhere as user friendly as the Apple iTunes software.

[title]:Avoid It - Not an MP3 Player
[fullText]:Listen to Gadgetphile's review - I got this player today as a birthday gift, and I get the CANNOT PLAY message for every MP3 that I own (yes, OWN; I've never downloaded an illegal MP3). Evidently, the people who love this player use Sony's music service and ATRAC format. Thank goodness the giver kept the receipt; this player is going back to the store tomorrow. As usual, Sony is so obsessed with proprietary formats that they've ruined their chances in another lucrative market. This is the Betamax of MP3 players.

[title]:Decent player, still inferior to the iPod
[fullText]:Overall, this MP3 player works fine. The included software (SonicStage) comes with a utility to convert MP3 files over to Sony's proprietary format - ATRAC. Converting the MP3's over to ATRAC3 format is kind of time consuming, but if you're trying to cram as many songs as possible on there it can be of benefit, since the file size is smaller after conversion.  The features of the unit are nice for such a low-end MP3 Player. You can adjust bass and treble, along with "Sound" level, which I gather is some kind of sound-enhancement utility. The little slider on the top of the unit is nifty, allowing you to switch between "Folder" mode and "Track" mode. I like to organize my music in folders so being able to switch between folders with ease is a must. The slider also allows you to go to "Hold" mode, which is a similar feature to locking the keypad on cell phones. If you select Hold mode, you can put the player in your pocket and not have to worry about accidentally pressing any buttons. Then, of course, you have standard options such as Repeat and Shuffle.  The SonicStage program interface is probably one of the worst designed applications I've ever seen, but transferring files in it isn't so difficult.  Overall I would say that if you have money for an iPod or an iPod Nano, get one. The only reason I got this instead of an iPod Shuffle was the LED on the front. I like having some kind of a display. But the iPod and iTunes are BY FAR the best products on the market when it comes to digital music. If you're just looking for something simple and cheap, and don't mind a little extra work then this is the player for you.

[title]:Gift for son
[fullText]:Teenagers love gadgets and this one saved the day.  We bought the Sony MP3 player for Christmas (we opened early) and I set up and downloaded the 5 songs that came free with the purchase of the player.  Setting up the software was a snap, and downloading the free songs was easy.  Moving them over to the player took less than 2 minutes and the playback was wonderful.  My son's friend has the same player, however an older version, and his headphones are not as good as my son's are.  This player has sound volume like I never imagined such a little player would have.  It's small and fits into a shirt pocket easily.  I also love that it came with all connectors and software, to include ear covers.  The music can be stored in folders or individually, which helps keep things in order.  The software also has the ability to transfer your current music into the network format, so you can have your favorite songs (legally purchased) converted over to the player.  I love it, and more importanly, my son really loves it!

[title]:Pretty good
[fullText]:This is my second mp3 player and I love it. Before buying this one I had a Creative Micro Zen, which was amazing, but worked for only a month, then the headphone jack brake and since I didn't have the guarantee (in fact I bought it in Canada and I live in Chile) I just sold it by pieces. Then I made an extensive research and I realized that-of the people I know-the ones with Sony mp3 players were the happiest, in fact they were more satisfied than the people who owned iPods. So I bought this player.  The first thing I liked about it is the small size and weight (useful). Putting music on it it's easy too, eventhough transforming 100 mp3 songs into atrac3plus took me like 2 hours o__o. Anyways...the sound it's nice too, I have some big noise-cancelling Phillip headphones and the player works really nice with them. Oh, and a AAA battery last a lot(I bought the player on Xmas and I haven't change the battery since then...).  So if you're looking for a cheap player, try this one, it's the best choice =)

[title]:great hardware, frustrating proprietary software
[fullText]:The hardware is great. I'm very impressed by the battery life, weight, etc. Unfortunately there are two problems with the software/firmware which are overly proprietary. 1. The device is incredibly finicky about codecs. Many files can be played only by converting them to WAV and back to MP3 or ATRAC. 2. There's no drag and drop, you have to use Sonic Stage to get files on the device. So if you plan on buying files from Sony or using Sony's software to rip cds, it's great. But if you want to leave the Sony bubble and use, say podcasts, it can be a serious hassle.

[title]:What a hassle!!!
[fullText]:Here's the rub. If you use a legal download service such as Rhapsody, the files won't play in this device. So, you are forced to use Sony's at $1.00 a track as opposed to .79 or less. I blew 20 bucks downloading from Rhapsody into my sony and it wouldn't recognize the files. Really a pain. I just wanted a small, lightweight MP3 player. What I got was a big pain in the butt.

[title]:Works like a charm
[fullText]:I have had mine for about 3 mobths.  It does exactly what I want it to do. I wanted it to play music in the car as I have a daily commute to work.  I have a tape player in my car, so I bought a tape deck converter and play the music from the sony network walkman through the stero system of my car.  The network walkman is very easy to use and the battery life is long.  Just remember to turn it off!  In my case when I turn off the car, the player is still playing and I have to manually turn it off or it runs down the battery.  The only thing that disappoints me about it, is now they have come out with the cutest pink/gray version.  Very girly and fun!

[title]:I HATE this device
[fullText]:All of my past MP3 players had a nice, easy, drag-and-drop interface for loading files, but this one insists upon using the Sonic Stage program to load files.  Since Sonic Stage crashes my computer every time I try to run it (there's a conflict with some other software I currently have loaded, and I gave up trying to find out which software it was) I'm stuck having to load Sonic Stage on my work computer.  This means every time I want to change music I have to burn my music to a disk and drag  the dang thing to work, load the music onto my hard-drive, re-start my computer, THEN add music to the MP3 player.  Mostly it just sits in a drawer at home because putting music on it is just too much hassle.  I think I've actually used it about five times since I "treated" myself to it for Christmas.  Great value for my money, huh?

[title]:Tough as nails, but I had to upgrade.
[fullText]:Well, I got this little dude for my birthday and by gosh by golly, it worked well.  It still does, but I gave it back to the person who gave it me so they could upgrade me to a Creative Zen Micro 5 gb.  They haven't filled up much if it, but they will ;-)  Okay, so here's the scoop:  -Dropped it on the sidewalk.  NOTHING happened! Not even a scratch! -Dropped it on the kitchen floor twice -Dropped it on hard carpet  None of those did ANY damage whatsoever.  And okay, I wish I could use iTunes with this, but oh well, Sonicstage is okay and it compresses quite well.  The sound quality is great, but if you want it to be excellent, hold the play mode button so it turns to S1, then press it again.  S2 is the best.  Also, you can put it on shuffle and stuff, which all of them could do, so I'll kinda count that out.  It is pretty cheap!  A 1 gb iPod Nano, which holds less somehow, actually costs twice as much.    Oh, and I love the battery life.  1 AAA battery lasts me about a month.  I like that better than charging my new one.  It's got a backlight.  Nothing special, but convenient nonetheless!  Last, but not least, it's TINY! And LIGHT!  I can't even tell it's in my pocket!  If you don't have a whole lot of music (25 CD's or so) this is perfect for you.  The space was adequate for about 9 months, and it was a good 9 months.

[title]:Ugh.  You can do better for less money....
[fullText]:First and most important, the battery life is NOT, repeat NOT, what it claims to be.  The only reason I purchased this thing is because I figured I would save money with the extra long battery life when it came time to purchase batteries.  Think again.  Strike one.  The sound quality is just plain bad.  Most of the time there is an awful hissing noise in the background.  I also like my music loud, but at full volume, you won't get eardrum-thumping sound, no matter what phones you use with it.  Strike two.  Sony's music connect service is the worst I have ever seen.  I purchased an album a year ago and it still can't finish the download.  Like a fool, I actually tried again and I still experienced the same problem.  Two albums purchased and no music to show for it.  MAJOR strike three.  This product sucks and so does Sony.

[title]:A solid little player
[fullText]:I've had this little player for probably 2 years now, and it's always been a very easy to use, dependable and TOUGH little unit. Mine's been left in the car for a week at -40, it's been stuck inside a hot glove compartment for days, it's been dropped, thrown, covered in dirt, all sorts of abuse, and yet it still runs beautifully. one AAA battery can run for 50-70 hours, depending on brand. Can't get much better then that! My ONLY complaint is there's no drag & drop option, you need the program, but thats minor.  As for people saying it won't play certain MP3s, out of all the times I've used it, I've only had that error on maybe 5 MP3s out of hundreds, and sometimes, just RENAMING the file so it's only alphanumeric made it work fine.

[fullText]:I don't know why people were annoyed with this MP3 player. It has simple instructions to follow, and only 6 steps to do everything. It was easy to intall the program for it, and it transferred my music to the program, which was awsome. It was really easy to transfer my music into it, and it lets you make your own playlists, then transfer them, which is wonderful. It's also great that you don't have to plug it in, you just have to change the battery, which is faster and makes the MP3 last longer. I love that it's a sony too, so I know it'll last a long time. In short, it's a great MP3 player!

[fullText]:So I have seen two pretty bad reviews here and let me tell you, those people are doing something wrong!  I have had my Sony Network Walkman for 2 days now and I LOVE IT!!   This is my first Mp3 player and being the technology idiot that I am, I was afraid that I would get this thing and it would take me days to figure out how to use it.  Well, within 15 minutes I was beginning the process of transfering the better part of my music collection onto this itsy bitsy tiny little thing.  It was so easy to use the software.  It even came with 5 free music downloads from SonicStage.  The thing I am most impressed with is the sound quality.  The only songs that suffered any quality (only a little bit) are songs that are copies of songs that are copies of songs that are copies of songs.  Understandable.  But the rest of them are crystal clear.  You can adjust the eq only a little bit, but for me, its enough.  I like the bass a little heavy and this player satisfies that.   All in all, I believe that I got really got my money's worth.  This absolutely a great purchase, I love it, I love it, I love it!

Here's a side by side comparison with the 1gb iPod shuffle:  - Number of songs:  iPod (240), Sony (680) - Battery life:  iPod (12 hours), Sony (70 hours)  It's not even a contest!  You don't even need a brain to figure this one out.  You'll waste 6 batteries on a Shuffle for every one on Sony.  I've never listed to a Shuffle but I can say the quality of the music on here is awesome.  However, I must admit I do own stock in Apple because I know all those dumb people out there will continue buying them!

[title]:Excellent MP3 player overall
[fullText]:Despite all the reviews out there warning about file transferring and sony mp3 players i decided to get this b/c it was the most banf for the buck.  The mp3 player and software are actually both pretty easy to use.  You just basically load the songs onto the software and transfer the songs onto the player.  Simple as that.  The software can convert the songs from mp3 format into atrac3-plus format when you are transferring songs, so that way the player can hold more songs.  I've uploaded a little over 500 songs onto my player at 64-kbps and the quality isnt noticeably different from my other mp3s.  Another good thing is that navigation is pretty easy on the mp3 player.  You basically organize your songs into "groups" and you name your groups, e.g. rock, sum 41, r&b, etc., and you can just browse to the group you want.  And you can shuffle/repeat the group you want or all the songs in the mp3 player.  You can also browse song-by-song, which doesnt take too long, the navigation goes pretty quickly when you hold down the buttons.  The battery life is also very good.  You can use the thing on one AAA for more than 40 hours.  The mp3 player also resumes the music you were playing immediately when turned on. So overall a great mp3 player, but for the following:  it takes a long time to organize and transfer songs onto the player, took me an entire day to do that.  Plus, although the group navigation kind of is adequate, i wish this player supported regular playlists.  I guess thats the drawback with flash mp3 players.  If you dont travel alot and can put up with charging, I would definitely suggest shelling out a few extra bucks for a mini harddrive player.  But this is a extremely good player for those taking trips where charging isnt covenient.  Another negative aspect as that the player is kind of flimsy.  Looks ok, but it doesnt seem to be extremely sturdy.  The player is extremely light, even with the battery installed, so goes good in your pocket or whereever.  I also own a larger 20GB harddrive mp3 player and I like this so much better.  It's lighter, and battery life is awesome, and just seems to be more hassle free.  Further, with the larger, i felt i was carrying around a ton of songs i never listened to, while with this, its always playing my favorite songs (sum 41 rules, btw).  Well, over all a terrific player.  Well worth its price.

[title]:Yes, it plays MP3 directly and yes, it supports drag-and-drop
[fullText]:Some of the reviews here contain materially false information.   This player plays MP3 songs directly, without the need to convert them to ATRAC3/ATRAC3plus format. This is covered at great length in the manual.  This player supports drag-and-drop for MP3 files. The SonicStage software is only necessary if you want to work with ATRAC. Look online for the appropriate version of Sony's "MP3 File Manager" (version 2.0 as of this writing).  For those who want to work with ATRAC, SonicStage is a stable and reliable application, when used in a stable and reliable environment. It is best to use Windows XP, install the lastest updates, use virus-checking software, and avoid running software from untrusted sources.

[title]:Easy to use, great sound, lots of songs, what's not to like?
[fullText]:I really don't understand the hyperbolic criticism of Sony's SonicStage software.  It took me all of five minutes to figure it out, without even looking at the manual.  Clearly, some of the reviewers here have failed to read THEIR manual.  There's no requirement to use SonicStage;  your PC will see the NW-E107 as just another USB-connected storage device.  Use Windows Explorer to drag and drop your MP3's, if that's the format you like... this unit plays them just perfectly.  I suppose if you have a humongous library of MP3's, and for some reason you really really really wanted to be able to manipulate them through SonicStage, you would become frustrated that you had to first "transfer" them into the SonicStage library and put them in a playlist.  But this really isn't the best use for the included software.  The advantage with SonicStage is realized for someone just starting with assembling a collection of portable music files.  The ATRAC3/ATRAC3plus compression algorithms designed by Sony allow you to cram an incredible amount of music onto this tiny podlet.  It's really remarkable... I'm currently walking around with 27 full-length cd's on mine.  This is plenty for me to choose from when I go running, or have to get on an airplane, or have an extended stint at the old computer keyboard at work.  The unit weighs practically NOTHING; the packaging it comes in weighs more than it does.  Even with the AAA battery in, it simply disappears in a shirt pocket, you don't even feel it there.  It's great when working out; when I'm out running I just pop it in the pocket of my shorts.    The controls are simple and intuitive.  Is it "feature rich?"  Gee, I dunno... it plays the songs, lets me access them easily, lets me shape the treble and bass (you get three preset levels, one the flat factory setting, the other two user configurable... I have one setting for general use and one for inside the motorcycle helmet).  You can preset a volume level that will be your default whenever you fire it up.  There's some other stuff it does, but that's all I ever need, so I haven't spent too much time monkeying around with the other features (lots of byzantine repeat modes that I would never use in a million years).  I program computers all day, the last thing I want to do is have to program my personal stereo.  I'm giving four stars instead of five because the little plastic plug that covers the USB port is kind of tricky to pry open, and because there's no way to clip this thing onto your clothes if you happen to be without a convenient pocket.  Also, I'm not totally sold on the earpod headphones... but I have a pair of Sony PSYC headphones that I love, so no biggie.  Otherwise I am totally pleased with this purchase.  Under $150, and I have triple the song capacity and triple the battery life of a $300+ iPod.  For me, that's worth sacrificing all of the file-sharing-with-friends features that probably appeal more to kids in high school and college.  I just want to listen to music.  This little guy does the job for me.

[title]:Buy the Right Thing!!!
[fullText]:After some careful research comparing players, I decided this Sony was the right player for me because 1) I primarily want to add music from my CD collection, and this software, despite everyone's bellyaching, produces MUCH better sound than IPOD's.  I earned my living as a music critic for svereal years, and the SONY sound is absolutely excellent. For classical music there's no comparison. 2) I travel overseas a lot and the ease of changing a little AAA battery, which lasts for 50 - 60 hours, is wonderful.  I know I'll have my music because I'm not dependent on finding outlets with the right plugs and risking blowing up my player on a bad voltage connection.    Many of the complaints seem to arise from assumptions made about the player and capabilities it was not intended to feature, rather than product which doesn't live up to its claims.  I've just bought a new SOMY Walkman A3000 20 GB because I want more storage, but I will keep this little beauty because it's the only one I know that runs on a battery. I'll also replace it if I can, should it's life run out before a newer version is available.

[title]:Awesome little player but something goes wrong 6 mos later
[fullText]:I love this little MP3 player from Sony!I have two of them. They are perfect for working out...BUT something majorly malfunctions after about 6 mos of use! When the player gets ready to go haywire, the battery will go dead- which seems to be an easy fix;I've replaced them successfully numerous times before, but this time when the battery is replaced, the player seems to lose its mind! The display reads "Data Access" and will not stay on for more than ten seconds, and flashes Data access every  subsequent time it blacks out.Within an hour or 2 of this happening, it ceases to work at all.When this problem felled the second player of mine yesterday,it popped loudly. I happened to be listening to it at the time. Sony charges a flat rate of $77.00 on any repair plus whatever costs might arise if they fix it,so there's little point in trying to repair one of these since you can go buy a new one for about the same price.There is apparently some design flaw,but these little players are AWESOME while they last. Just wish Sony could get them perfected...

[title]:Great player...CAN transfer mp3s without using SonicStage
[fullText]:This player works great. I have owned it for a little over a year now and it has been going strong. I wanted to clear up a few misconceptions that older reviews seem to focus on...this player DOES NOT have to be used with Sonic Stage software...at some point, Sony included a download in their updates section that allows you to download an mp3 transfer program. Although it's not as nice as the drag/drop format of a newer player, it sure beats importing to ATRAC and then converting to MP3. You can find this download on Sony's support site at:  http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-download.pl?mdl=NWE107&upd_id=1936&os_id=99  For some, since this player doesn't have any functions like voice recording, fm player/recorder or sleep timer that some of the newer players now have it may not be worth it to buy this model. For people like me who just want a simple mp3 player, nothing else I've seen comes close to touching the 60 hours of playback time that I can get from one single AAA battery. (I also own a Sansa m240 mp3 player and only get 16 hours from the same size battery and can take the dead battery out of the Sansa and it will play another 5-6 hours in this Sony!)

[fullText]:If you take a magnificent piece of hardware and put horrible software, what do you get?  JUNK!!!  The HARDWARE construction of this product is OUTSTANDING!  The SOFTWARE is absolutely USELESS!!!  PRO's: - Sound quality is AMAZING for coming from such a small package.  Speakers are only about 1.5" in diameter, but deliver the sound of a large boombox!  (Almost seems like the Bose cube speakers) - Size is incredibly small for such a huge-sounding device (7" W x 2" D x 2.5" H) - Stylish with a clear-on-white body finish (very Apple-ish style) - Battery life is very good -- It has always lasted through lengthy cook-outs (Labor Day, etc.) and is a great way to bring big music to a party without wires. - Carrying case looks like it will take a beating and protect the unit.  CON's: - Software is HORRIBLE!  It requires that you install their version of Musicmatch.  No other way to get music onto it.  Even then, you have to jump through many hoops to get it to work -- VERY FRUSTRATING!!! - 256 MB of memory - Radio reception is terrible (can't get ANYTHING, even with the antenna) - USB 1.1 takes about 30 minutes to load the full 256 MB with music - Sporatic crashing (must be reset by jamming a paperclip into a rubber nub in the back) - Ruberized door on back has cheap snap-shut clips that break off within a few uses (back panel is always open now)  Once you've suffered through the painful music loading process, you will swear never to change the music on this thing again!  However, with only 256 MB, you will soon be tired of what seems like 10 songs over, and over again.  To sum it up, the concept for this unit has great potential -- but not the way it's implemented!  Sound is great and awesome for BBQ's, beach, etc.  Philips needs to make it compatible with other software products and allow track drag-and-drop onto the device.  Windows Media Player will NOT work on this.

[title]:Very nice, but no excuse for the easy scratching
[fullText]:It looks great, it sounds great, it has go-anywhere-but-in-the-water practicality. But there is no longer any excuse for Apple to make iPods that scratch as soon as you get them out of the box. There are now clear, scratch-proof coatings, such as the DURABIS polymer TDK has invented for blank DVDs, and Apple should be using them. iPods would keep their cool factor for a lot longer if they didn't get scratched up so quickly. Early reports suggest that the battery life meets the product specs, but it is important to keep an eye on this since Apple is not famous for being forthcoming about battery performance. iPod battery life has never been impressive at its best.

[title]:Cool MP3 Player! Add some accessories to make it better
[fullText]:This is the coolest MP3 player I've ever seen! You wont believe how thin it is until you try to hold it on your palm! Here are some reasons why I love this MP3 player:  - Incredibly small, thin, and very light. - Well designed, fit on your palm, pocket, or pencil case. - High resolution colour screen, shows albumart, photos, and games in colors. - Superb sound. - Click wheel; easy navigation as the original iPod. - New features:   > World Clock   > Stopwatch   > Screen Lock - now with iTunes 5, it's easy to sync AddressBook, Calendar, etc between Ms Outlook and iPod nano. - with flash memory, the nano is 100% skip free; a true sport companion. - headphone jack at the bottom, making it easier to read the screen (without rotating it first) when we take the nano out from our jeans pocket.  Although it comes with lots of advantages, yet:  - 4 GB is the maximum capacity possible. - USB connection only. - No charger adapter, you should use the USB connection to recharge the battery. It means the computer or laptop should be around you. Make sure you bring your laptop on your vacation. - Only two colors available, black or white. No more pink, blue, green, etc.  Accessories that you may like: - The lanyard. With this earphone, you can wear your iPod nano as necklace. No more tangle and you can change the music right away without reaching your pocket. - The silicon case. This silicon case comes in colors and will change the look of your iPod nano. It will also protect your iPod from scratches and prevents it from sliding on a tilted table or slipped out of your pocket when you're sitting.   Overall this is a really great product! Before deciding to buy this MP3 player, make sure you have USB 2.0 on you computer or laptop. Some people had bought this nano and having USB 1 connection on their PC, making the song transfer a painful and time consuming process. It will takes hours to fill up your iPod nano with USB 1. Therefore, the existance of USB 2.0 on your PC is crucial. Also, if you are frequent traveller, it is a good idea to buy another accessory for recharging the battery og your iPod without connecting it to PC. Otherwise, you will have to bring your laptop with you or look for PCs on your vacation to recharge your nano.

[title]:Awesome device!
[fullText]:This thing rocks! I received it as a present and really love it. This is my first iPod of any kind, so here goes.  The Good: 1) Size & Design - Need I say more? It is very small and looks stunning. Apple have done it again!  2) Easy-to-use Software - You use iTunes to organize your files and import them to the player. It can also be automatically synchronized to add or delete files to your player as needed. 3) Good Sound Quality - The quality from the earphones is wonderful. Bass, mids, treble: all there!  The Bad: 1) Picture Import - Pictures can only be imported by folder, so if you want to put just ONE picture into the device, you have to create a separate folder for it and then import that. 2) Scratches - Nanos, especially the black ones, get scratched VERY easily. Note this before you put it to use and perhaps purchase the necessary bag/film/other protector to keep it looking new. 3) Battery Replacements - I'm actually not sure about this, but this thing looks like it's solidly closed. Will there be a way to change the internal battery when it expires? I don't know.  This is a super player! You will love it! Buy it! :)

[title]:I'm glad I slept on the iPod mini
[fullText]:After being an ipod owner for the last two years, I was in the market for a second iPod. I slept on the iPod mini and I'm glad because now there's the iPod mini. I love it. I was worried that it'd be a total drag to set up but it was perfectly compatible with all my previous iTunes stuff. I didn't have to even load the included CD all I did was downlaod the latest verisons of the iPod updater and I made sure that I had the latest upgrade of iTunes.  The nano works with all my previous cables for my 3rd generation iPod. So after I removed it from the package I plugged it in my previous iPod's AC adapter. The one draw back is the nano does not include an AC adapter but you can still charge it with the usb cable. I was able to get a full charge in about an hour with the AC adapter. With that said, I highly reccomend this amazing mp3 player. It exceeded my expectations. The ease of use, the design, everything is wonderful. Now you may think...why spend money on an mp3 player that only holds 500 songs? Well, how many people do you know that have time to listen to 5000 songs everyday? I can manage my playlists. I control what's being fed into my iPod and I like that. This is a great 2nd iPod for current iPod owners and a treat to first time buyers.

[title]:A good product, as old as it is.
[fullText]:It's probably been about 2 years since a review was writting for this iPod, but hey; I'm bored, and it's 3:35 AM. Anyway, I originally bought this thing a couple of years ago. It's still functioning properly and I've never had that many problems with it, and you can't imagine how many times this thing's been beaten around! The battery life has been pretty exceptional, though I can tell it has been getting a lot worse for the couple of years I've had it. I really thought I would have to replace the battery, but that was unnecessery.   To this day, I have been using this iPod with no problems (other than some click wheel problems, but that was easily fixed), and if you don't want to spend so much on the newer ones, this one's for you. I honestly can't compare this Nano with the other two generations, but all I know is that this one is durable, reliable, and easy to use. I may be getting the latest generation of the Nano by tomorrow (Dec. 17, 2007. The new nano with video capabilites) and I'll see if I can do a quick comparison between the two when I get it. I'll post the comparison on the Nano: Black product.

[title]:BATTERY SUCKS
[fullText]:So I was the first kid on the floor with the IPOD NANO, I ordered one from MAC the Monday of release.  It arrives, we all OOOOH and AHHHHH I take it home and charge it for the night Wake up at 5:30, fully charged battery, put it on and get on with my day, by 10 AM the battery had DIED CRAP!  I call up MAC and they want to REPAIR this one I say HELL NO!  I just BOUGHT it, I am not sending this back for you to REFURBISH it, I want a new one, and you screwed up my inscription, too.....  So I am getting ready to mail this back, when I charge the  battert ONE more time, all night charge, fresh in the AM  This time, it stayed on from 7:30, when I started to use it until 1:26PM, an hour ago, my NANO died from poor battery power.  Watch out when you get these, I am going to return this and hope I get a better one, if I get another POOR BATTERY, I am going to get a freaking refund, this is BOGUS  MAC should know better than to release a product that is crap  :/

[title]:Excellent addition to the iPod lineup, some caveats
[fullText]:Replacing the iPod mini in the middle of Apple's iPod line, the nano fills the spot nicely, bringing a lot of nice features and a few compromises.   The nano uses flash memory chips for storing the music and data, unlike the 1" hard drive found in the mini and 1.8" drive in the full-size iPods. The benefits of the flash memory are multifold - battery life is very good, there's no skipping, and no chance of damage to moving parts from shock. An added benefit is that songs load up instantly, unlike on hard drive based iPods where there would be a slight delay as the hard drive spun up if the song requested wasn't in the memory buffer.  The nano also takes cues from its bigger brothers, with a very bright color screen with higher resolution than the mini's (176x132 vs. 138x110), photo viewing capability, and the signature white and silver body. It also has a few exclusive features, including a nifty Stopwatch, a Screen Lock feature styled after a combination lock, and an enhanced Clock. Unfortunately like the mini, you can't install Mac OS X on it and use it as a boot disk.  In usage, the nano works like a charm, though the bottom-mounted headphone jack takes a little getting used to after four years of it being on top. Battery life ranges from 12-15 hours in mixed usage, with it coming in on the low side if I listen to high-bitrate files (probably has to read from more memory). The screen is wonderful when the backlight is on, but visibility outside isn't as good as the old monochrome screens.  Despite its positives, the nano has some things that aren't so great. The headphone jack is located on the bottom and has no additional connector like on past non-Shuffle iPods, so the remote control no longer has a place to plug in. This also means that accessories that use the remote port like FM transmitters will not work. It goes without saying the accessory manufacturers will produce a ton of goodies for the nano by virtue of it being an iPod, so the concern is mainly for iPod owners with existing accessories or things on the market currently that won't work with the nano.  In going with a clear plastic/stainless steel design like the big iPods, the nano is more scratch and dent prone, unlike the mini, which was a tank with its rugged aluminum casing. I've already scuffed the back of the nano after only five days of usage, while my 18-month old mini looks virtually new. The nano also features a miniaturized version of the excellent Click Wheel, which can be a little tough to work for those with big fingers. It doesn't depress as far and the center portion is flush with the unit, which makes selecting things a bit tough occasionally.   Of note is that the nano cannot connect to your computer over FireWire, though it will charge. USB is the only way to sync, and users with the older USB spec will be waiting a while to fill up the nano. Even with photo viewing abilities, the nano cannot output it to a TV like big color iPods, so the implementation is halfway since the screen is too small for any extended viewing. On this initial firmware revision (1.0), navigating back and forth through menus can get a little laggy at times, with the menus not coming on smoothly if you press the buttons too fast.   After countless iPods Apple still has not included an easily-replaceable battery, so when it eventually dies you'll either have to send it back to Apple or attempt to crack the nano open. The lithium-polymer battery Apple uses will last anywhere from 18 months to 3 years depending on how often it's recharged and how it's used. Running your iPod until it's completely dead (total discharge) is bad for the battery, and will cut down on its lifespan.  Apple's been bringing the price of iPods down steadily, but has been accomplishing this partly by cutting down on accessories packed in the box. My 3G iPod came with a wealth of goodies, but the nano only comes with the omnipresent white earbuds, a CD, USB cable, and a piece of plastic to enable the nano to fit into future docking accessories. The buds look neat, but the sound quality leaves much to be desired. Picking up a quality pair of headphones will do wonders for your auditory experience.  I've owned every iPod since the original 5GB unit all the way back in 2001. For its greater capacity and use as a backup drive I'm keeping my 60GB iPod photo around, but for daily use the nano is where it's at. It deftly combines the advantages of the flash-based Shuffle with the perks of the full-sized iPods and adds its own unique tricks to the bag. Packing 4GB of flash memory with all of its advantages at a decent price is no small feat, and the smallness of the the design has to be held to be believed. Not many reservations, and definitely recommended.

[title]:Before you take the plunge ...
[fullText]:I love the iPod. Always have. At home, we have five, including this one: the 4GB iPod nano.  Before you leap, realize two things: (1) this iPod is extremely fragile compared to other iPods, particularly the tough-as-nails iPod mini (a drop of a couple of feet onto a linoleum floor took out the screen); and (2) the black version gets scratched very easily, and shows scratches far more than any white iPod I've owned (after a day and before dropping the damn thing, it already looked awful from scratching -- and it was treated with kid gloves).  Okay, if you can live with those caveats, and invest in a durable protector (we bought the arm-band holder, which does a lousy job of protecting the iPod nano)--none of which are out yet--then this new iPod is truly an amazing bit of technology. It's tiny (it feels even smaller than the photos suggest), has great sound quality (better, I think, than any other iPod I've owned), and the display is gorgeous (even though tiny).  For me, the mini (now defunct, but bargains still abound) is the better choice given its sturdiness. I'm not up for museum-relic care for my electronics, which would certainly help if you own one of these.  Another beautiful, functional gizmo from Apple. Just know what you're getting. Some websites claim the nano is sturdy. I can tell you, from first hand experience, it isn't. So, you be the judge. (Sure, the thing still played, but replacing the screen will set you back at least $90, and, even on the web sites in question, the screen broke.)  (Oh, and if you see someone taking shots at the iTunes software, don't believe it. It's the best music software out there, and its integration with this--or any--iPod is a joy.)

[title]:Great, but still not scratch resistant!
[fullText]:The Ipod Nano is a very worthy successor to the wildly popular Ipod mini and is a great addition to the Ipod family.  This thing is tiny.  You won't believe how tiny it really is until you have it in your hands.  The Nano pretty much does everything the big 20g Ipod can do, except it holds only 1000 songs with 4g model and 500 with the 2g as well as photos and album art.  It also includes a stopwatch which is handy when I go running.  It is also extremely light.  I thought the Mini was light, but this feels like a feather not to mention extremely thin.  It slides into my front pocket with ease.  The screen is smaller of course, but doesn't lose its clarity.  There is also the return of the touch sensitive click wheel first introduced on the Ipod Mini.  It works very well sifting through songs in seconds.  The Nano comes in the familar white and a very slick black, however the black one will definitely show more scratches.  Gone are the variety of colors of the Mini.  The only gripe I have about the Nano is that it is extremely proned to scratches.  I was extremely careful with it even handling it with a microfiber cloth, yet still managed to get scratches on it.  I don't know if it's only me, but I get really anal about scratches on brand new products I've bought.  You would think after coming out with the other Ipods that suffered the same problem, Apple would've been smart and covered the Nano with a scratch resistant material.

[title]:Reluctantly elevated to "necessity"
[fullText]:I didn't want to like the iPod Nano.  I bought an iPod Mini for my girlfriend.  I thought it was cool.  But never seriously considered getting one for myself.  I own a pretty nifty Pocket PC cellphone (the I-Mate Jam - highly recommended, BTW).  I've always been happy with storing my songs on an SD. My cellphone gave me communications, games, music, productivity (excel, etc.), and got lots of "techno-geek" points. The last thing I wanted was yet another electronic gadget to carry around.  Then I made the mistake of taking a look at this newest creation of Steve Job's Apple. I was blown away. It's SO SMALL. And, very stylish. And very useable. And, at 4 GB, adequate for all but the most demanding consumers. And, at this price, it's cheaper than buying memory cards totalling up to 4 GB.  Instant there was no question of not owning one. I reluctantly, but secretly proudly, now carry an iPod Nano to complement my cellphone. I'm afraid that I won't be using my PocketPC phone to listen to music anymore.  Apple truly blows me away. Kudos to Steve Jobs for his remarkable transformation of his company into the most innovative mass market tech company out there. Anyone who knows Steve Jobs history with Apple knows how remarkable his task really has been. Also, anyone who knows the story about Apple computer and the initial problems with the name of the company understands how ironic this whole field of innovation is!  In conclusion, buy this product. Beg, borrow, or steal - well, not steal. Use any legal and ethical manner of getting your hands on one of the Nanos. You SO won't regret it!

[title]:The new iPod, looking good.
[fullText]:I just picked up my iPod Nano last night. I totally thought this thing was going to suck. Man oh man was I wrong. This thing is beyond belief. This thing is so damn small its unbelieveable. It is definitely worth getting if you don't need all that extra space.  Size: The thing is really small and about the width of a pencil. It is really light. You need to see this thing up close. The commercials don't depict the right image. The click wheel is smaller, and the main button in the center is slightly bigger. The screen is small, but then again its the Nano. The backside is metal, just like the regular iPod. I'd take care of that because it fingerprints and scratches. Then again you can't help the fingerprints. For such a small iPod, this thing is impressive.  New Things: Alright lets start out with placement. The hold button is on the top left, and is small, you might need to use your fingernails. The headphone slot is on the bottom left. It comes with the regular headphones, although I thought they were the one that goes around your neck. The slot for the USB is right next to the headphone jack, and surprisingly the only way to charge it, if you don't have the additional charger. If you do have the additional charger your in luck, because it does work with the nano. But just be careful if you have the USB charger, because if it runs out of battery, your pretty much screwed. The color screen is really clear, and enhances everything. Cover art is available if you get it from iTunes. The features that are new in the iPod are compelling. There is a world clock, stopwatch, screen lock, and everything else you are used to.   Packaging: The packaging is different. The box is smaller, and is black if you get the white Nano. It opens up to the iPod on the right, then the supplies on the left. They are in a open up pouch on the top. There are two small packages. One contains instructions, stickers, and an iTunes 5 installer. The other package is contained with headphones, an additional add on to the dock, the USB cord, and covers for the headphones.   Quality: I got the white Nano, mainly because I am big about scratches. There are unfortunately a couple on the screen, but when the backlight is on, they are hard to see. If you get the black be careful about scratches. I am waiting for a case to protect it. If you want to wipe off something dont use your shirt. Use a Kleenex, or something soft. The sound quality is better as well. The screen quality is also better especially with a color screen.  Pros and Cons.  Pros: -Very slim put it anywhere, wait for a case before you put it in you pocket. -Sound quality is better. -Color screen. -Additional features. -Battery goes for about 14 hours, 10 hours with backlight  Cons: -Only charges with the USB cord, unless you buy the AC charger. -Scratches...ehh they are annoying, especially with the black.  -Need to take great care of it, avoid dropping it.  With all cons gone, this thing is for you! If you want a durable little iPod, and are not too obsessed about music, forget the shuffle and get this! I highly reccomend it.

[title]:Absolutely Astonishing!!!
[fullText]:If you think the pictures and T.V. ads for this look impressive, wait until you actually get your hands on it. I got a nano just a couple of days ago after giving my old 15 gig iPod (the one with the row of 4 buttons above the scroll wheel) to my dad. This iPod is so incrediblely small and light weight. The screen is very bright and vibrant and pics look great on it. The sound quality is excellent as with all other iPods, and all of the great features, plus a couple new ones (stopwatch, world clock, screen lock), are here. The click wheel, although a little smaller than the ones on other iPods, is very accessable and easy to use. At 4 gb, you will probabally be able to get just over 1,000 songs on it, which is a very good ammount for the average person. All in all, this iPod is great and definitely has a "Wow Factor" that will facinate you when you see it.  Pros: *Amazingly Small and Lightweight *Great Sound Quality *Great Features That iPod's are Known For *Nice, Bright Color Screen  Cons: -Will not work with all older iPod accessories

[title]:Lack of VIDEO-OUT is a fundamental flaw
[fullText]:I waited through the iPod evolution and finally bought the 4G iPod (clickwheel) in 2004. The hard disk technology broke 3 times within a year (under warranty) and then finally a 4th time the week after the one-year warranty expired. I swore I would never again buy another hard disk-based iPod. The very next week, the iPod Nano was release. I was mesmerized. It sounded perfect! Granted the 4GB version has a $150 profit markup, is easily scratched, delicate and low memory capacity (only 4GB), but at least it was flash-drive based. I actually bought this the next week, and returned it before opening it once I found out that it didn't have VIDEO-OUT capabilities for photos and no FireWire capabilities, as the regular iPod's did. Those were deal-breakers for the tiny $250 device. I will wait a bit longer for the 2nd generation Nano which hopefully will have VIDEO-OUT and FireWire capabilities (and hopefully more memory) even if they have to be a bit larger. The iPod and iPod Mini's are small enough for me already; I like the Nano for its flash-drive technology (for prospective reliability reasons).

[title]:Discreet Ipod
[fullText]:I have definitely known what it has been like with so many people in the MP3 craze. It has been so popular, people aren't buying music anymore from the basic music Mom & Pop shops anymore. While that has been the case, the ones that majority of people have went to are the Ipods. Since they came out a few years ago, Apple has truly lead the MP3 player market at least 2 to 1. While there have been so many different styles of Ipods like the regular, the Ipod mini and the shuffle, there is one that can be just easier to take anywhere your heart desires from the inside of your pocket. This is it.  The Apple Ipod nano edition, is a far better version than the lackluster Ipod Shuffle was when it was introduced. This MP3 player device can hold just about the same amount of songs as the Ipod mini, 1,000 songs, yet it is so small you can just just put it conviently anywhere. The Ipod nano has all the abilities that the regular Ipod and the Ipod mini have, with a convient LCD screen, that displays the menu and songs well. While it does have some bright spots, there is one disadvantage with this device. Although it is uniquely well, it has a short battery life, and not as much as some other MP3 players have. Even the Ipod mini have a slightly longer battery life by just only 4 hours.  While there are so many different MP3 players on the market, the Apple Ipod nano is a great buy for anybody who wants to get into the MP3 craze while it is hot. I have tried this quaint player in the stores, and I liked it a lot, and Ipod know you will too.  Portability: B+  Display: B+  Price: B  Enjoyment: B 1/2+  Overall: B 1/2+

[title]:What nobody has mentioned yet ... SOUND!!!
[fullText]:This isn't going to be long and boring because everything good/bad has been said so far. Good - size, flash memory, photo ability, etc..  Bad - I got black and it scratches VERY easily! I only had it 2 days and from carrying it in my pocket, the front looks very scratched like I had it a few years already.  Also, don't know why they put the headphone jack on the bottom ... and so far there's no belt clip for this.  Only a lanyard headphone or an armband.  I need a belt clip for the gym.  Anyway, the sound ...  I only listen to my players CRANKED!  Every MP3 player I've ever bought, including my previous 3 ipods, I listen to at full volume.  So, just to test, I got my 6 gb ipod mini and put it side by side with my new Nano.  I started "Walk" by Pantera simultaneously on both players and took my best pair of headphones going back and forth from one player to the other.  Well, the new Nano BLEW AWAY my 6 gb ipod!  Noticeably louder, deeper bass, and my favorite, much sharper and higher treble!  I hate to admit it, but it makes my 6 gb mini sound like crap. (Hello ebay!) I can't comment on the battery life yet at that volume, but I'm sure it will be much shorter than the 14 hours they say.  But if you buy this player for no other reason ... buy it for the SOUND!

[title]:I love it
[fullText]:I have had my iPod Nano for about a week now and I really like it.  My first impression of it was how small it was.  Small enough but not to small, they struck a good balance with the Nano.    The screen is a very resolution so it can show more information than the larger screen on the mini, not to mention that it's also in color.  The sound quality is great and it has a very good range of volume levels.  This player is another good one from Apple and an improvement over the mini.  My only problem I have with Nano is that any finger prints shows up on the black surface and the shiny metal back.  The black surface is very easy to scratch. But overall a great product.

[title]:Simply Brilliant
[fullText]:I've had my nano for a week and a half now and am loving it.  It is so tiny that I can carry it in my wallet - but it is still sized well to hold comfortably in the hand.  The sound quality and output is excelent.  The black does show fingerprints and scratches easily, but it just looks way to cool.  It is comfortable to use and the screen (though slightly smaller than the other ipods) is very crisp and easy to read.  Navigation with the clickwheel is just as easy as the larger ipods.  And I actually like the headphone port on the bottom better than on top (and I don't use a lanyard) - it just makes more sense-it takes some getting use to, but once you do, you'll love it just as much as you like everything else about the Nano.  This thing is super durable and you don't need to worry about breaking it.  Some complain about the price, but really, it is an excellent buy - you're paying for:  4gb of flash storage (the 1st flash player anywhere near that much storage), the tiny size, the color screen, and the flatout beauty of this thing.  No other player comes even close.  Just buy it!

[title]:Using I-Pod Nano with USB 1.1 Macs
[fullText]:I purchased the nano from my local Fry's electronics.  4gig, black.  I'm using it with a 1Ghz Powerbook G4 15" 10/10/1000 ethernet, DVI, but NOT USB 2.0...  which poses a problem because the Nano does not support sync via firewire.(although it can be charged over firewire)  The lack of firewire, my only real complaint about the nano, and aside from that, there is very little to find fault in aside from an overly bright screen (see below).  I've overcome the lack of firewire compatability by upgrading my laptop to USB 2.0 through the purchase of a $24 USB 2.0 PCMCIA card from Fry's.  For about the same cost as what I would have had to pay for the firewire cable anyway (if it were useful for anything other than charging) I have a PCMCIA card that provides compatability in addition to fast USB for external hard disks, etc...  The mac (osx panther) recognized the card immediately, without the need for drivers, etc.  Sync was very very fast, transfering complete songs in less than 1 second per song in many cases.  FAST transfers.  Fry's had numerous models of cards, some with Firewire and USB 2.0, other's with just firewire, and still others with only USB.  I purchased the least expensive, USB 2.0 only card that, only on the back of the package in fine type did it mention macs... and it works almost perfectly.  (note unplug the card before closing the powerbook lid or it won't sleep, and won't wake up the monitor, forcing a restart... this is the only issue I've encountered)  Regarding the Nano.  Small, stupid small, almost too small...almost.  Click wheel works great, volume is powerful, songs are accessed immediatly with no delay (flash memory).  As there is no hard disk to be scrambled from impacts, it is able to take minor drops without issue.  And when it does fall, the thing is so light that it almost always falls softly.  Syncs are very very quick using USB 2.0.  (I frequently wipe all the songs and re-upload rather than poke through them when I want to make changes.  Uploading about 3 gigs of music takes around 30-40 seconds at most)  The unit is light weight enough that I often pick it up by the headphone cord with no fear of it unplugging and falling.  The stock earbuds sound great, but hurt my ears after extended listening.  I currently use some foam earbuds I already owned.  Others have no problems with the ear buds, so I think it's just dependant upon the shape of one's ears.  My only other complaint and I'm sure it can be overcome with a firmware upgrade, is that the white LED back light is blindingly bright at night.  When in the car using it, it actually almost hurts to look at it.  When the back light turns off, it does so by quickly fading out, so the capability to vary brightness is there, and needs to only have a menu option added to control it for low light use.  If I had to think up anything else wrong, I would say it the black moel shows fingerprints and smudges too easily. (but it looks sooo good in black)... but really, disregarding the lack of firewire which I'm sure would have added size, and since mose people already have USB 2.0 anyway could afford to be sacrificed... If the best complaints I can come up with are "a screen that's too bright", and "shows smudges", then this one is most certainly a winner.    -Jason

[title]:not perfect, but as good as you are gonna get for a while
[fullText]:style is everything as far as the ipod nano is concerned.  i went out and bought a 4gb black the day it came out, not knowing that it would be in such a short supply in later days.  after playing with it for a couple of weeks, i would say that it is the best mp3 player to date, all things considered.  yet, it is far from being perfect, and i don't ask for much.  i just want a recording feature, like a lot of the low end cheap mp3 players, but no ipod nano doesn't come with recording feature.  otherwise, ipod nano is the perfect companion to my 60gb ipod, which is getting heavier and bulkier by the day.

[title]:THE biggest revolution
[fullText]:When Steve Jobs said the nano wiould be the biggest revolution since the original iPod, he wasn't kidding. The nano is the most impressive thing I have ever held in my hands. I was really into this product from the start, but certain aspects of the player never hit me until I actually held it.  The day I got mine, my jaw droppped. How could something so small be an iPod? Well, after using mine, I know this is by far the best mp3 player I have ever seen.  I wont go into the specs, as other reviewers already have.   But I will state some things that are wrong with it.  First, I was somewhat disapointed to hear it was USB 2.0 only. My old iPod was firewire, and since I have a mac computer, I never really ever used 2.0. The time to load music was noticable. While takes my 3rd gen Ipod to load my entire library only about 5 minutes, it took my nano about 8-10 minutes to lload only 800 songs. Its not that big a deal, but still...  The other thing is not really that big a deal either, but it is something i found wierd about the player. The headphone jack is on the bottom, instead of on top like it had been for 4 years. I mean, its not the end of the world, I just find that choice very odd.  One other thing a lot of people have talked about was value. Yes, this little guy is somewhat of a rip off. Why not just pay $50 more, and get an iPod with 5 times the space? Again, it comes down to "cool" factor, something the Nano drips of.  However, these "flaws" would by no means make me change my mind on my purchase. This is still THE mp3 product on the market. I bought mine becuase I love apple stuff, and my old one was dying on me. Im glad I bought this thing.

[title]:Great MP3 Player
[fullText]:This is a great unit.  More memory than you could possibly need, plus the added bonus of picture viewing.  I've had this one since March 2006 with no technical issues, and I have heard that the new ones that come in different colors have problems so it's too bad they don't make this one anymore.  The menu is easy to navigate and finding the song you want is simple.  The do it yourself on-the-go playlist is great so you can change and add the songs you want to hear.  Great player, definitely buy a cheap wall charger and/or car charger for this because the color screen chews up the battery life.

[title]:Best tiny video mp3 player I could find
[fullText]:My irrational desire to possess a tiny movie playing gadget eventually led me to buy the 4GB Creative Zen V.  Of the video MP3 players available on Amazon, it seemed to have the fewest negative reviews.  Other video MP3 players made by different companies tended to die quickly and could not be revived or fixed.  I've owned mine for about 3 months and it's still working.  I'm generally happy with it.  The positive:  -The controls are pretty easy to manipulate.  The manual teaches you the basics and refers you to a website for the complete controls -The software seems to work well for organizing songs on the player and converting 30 minute video files to be played on the player -It's impressively tiny -Good color and picture on the screen and good sound on the audio  The negative: -While the player's flash memory is large enough to hold a full 2 hour movie and more, the conversion software can't seem to convert a video that is longer than about 30 minutes -This last point is sort of moot if you consider how rarely you'll actually be watching something longer than a few minutes on a 1 inch screen.  So, the tiny screen could be considered a negative when you realize the actual experience of watching a video.  If you've read this far, you may ask yourself if you really want a tiny video player.  I'm still charmed by this gadget, but I honestly never watch videos on it.  It's not often that a tiny video player is useful.  It's just kind of fun!

[title]:Player for a Year...
[fullText]:This is very nice little gadget here (maybe even too small for me). It sounds fantastic, the earphones are pretty good, so is the radio. Video player though is useless. It is promised to have 15 hour battery life?! Might be so, but with embedded Lithium ion battery it is 40 % less a year from now. Since the battery is not replaceable, lifespan of the player is only few years. Before you buy, consider that after the battery is worn-out, so is the the player.

[fullText]:I just got my Zen V for christmas and absolutely love it!  I got it mostly to download and listen to eAudiobooks and it works great.  You can download books from NetLibrary and [...]  Unlike listening to audiobooks on CD, you can set bookmarks anywhere you want to leave off.  You can also fast forward and reverse whithout going all the way back to the previous bookmark.  I find the buttons easy to navigate. I also received the Zen Aurvana headphones--they really do enhance the sound quality and block out ambient noise.

[title]:Zen V - Almost Like It A Lot
[fullText]:The Zen V mp3 player does the job.   The Good...it's compact, it looks great, it's convenient and provides a good sound. The Bad...the onboard menu / controls are not the easiest to master, the pc computer software (used to set up the Zen onboard menu) should show a simulated view of what you see on the Zen onboard menu.  What you see is not what you get.  I am not a big fan of ear buds...not the most comfortable thing, but the ear buds do the job. The Ugly...I greatly dislike the recharging system for the Zen V. The Zen V charges its battery through its USB interface with a pc.  The Zen V must be connected to a pc to charge the battery.  When I first got the Zen V, I connected it to a USB interface on my pc and thought that the Zen battery was charging.  Turns out that the pc's USB interface was not powered but I had no way of knowing that.  With continued use of the Zen, I eventually discharged the Zen V battery and then lost all the music that I had so meticulously loaded on from my pc.  After some research and some phone calls to Creative, I learned that some USB interfaces on the pc are powered but most are not.  Furthermore, I learned that the Zen V has a low blue light that dims in and out during charging.  This is how you know that your Zen is connected to a powered USB interface.    I travel quite a bit and cannot charge the Zen V when I travel (I don't lug a pc around with me).   Finally, I got smart and purchased an aftermarket transformer / charger  that charges the Zen V from a standard electric wall outlet.  I wish Creative had included the transformer / charger with the Zen V.  It would have saved me so many headaches.   Would I purchase the Zen V again?  Yes.  Could Creative have done a better job with software and the charging system?  Yes.

[fullText]:The Zen V is just the right size for me, both physically and electronically. It has plenty of storage for my needs, since I only want it for music, not pictures, video, or as a PDA. It took me a little time to get things organized to my liking, but accessing it via my PC made things a lot easier. The included software is excellent, allowing the aforementioned PC access and  finding information on the CD being uploaded. I'm an online music novice, but this makes it fairly easy. Nice work, Creative.

[fullText]:I bought this in Sept 06, and have had trouble from day one and since.  It freezes up, then it takes me 10 to 15 minutes to reset it.  Then several times I have got the message "no license to play".  It took me awhile to figure out how to fix that. I can't get it to fast forward to the next song.  And the tiny joystick fell off inside of the player.  So now I have to try to navigate it with my fingernail. I have emailed the Creative company several times, they are no help. I was almost ready to throw it away today because it froze up again.  But when it is working, it is great! I absolutely love having a MP3 player.  Does anyone know of one that is trouble free (or almost)?

[fullText]:I've had one of these players plus an 8 gig and the Creative Vision M for almost a year now and they are all excellent music players.  I have had no technical problems.  They are easy to use and have good sound quality however, I can't vouch for the earbuds that come with them because they were too big to go in my ears.  It is easy to download or transfer music onto them as they accept a wide variety of files.  Video quality is good even on the smaller players.  Creative gets my vote over IPOD everytime.  It's a superior product (or at least an equal one) that has more features (i.e. radio tuner and video capability on smaller machines) for a lower price PLUS they don't force you to shop at iTunes.  I would buy another one in a heartbeat.

[title]:huge mistake
[fullText]:Do not buy this. The 40gb hard drive and the "features" mask the true quality of this product. The firmware is terrible. Folder and filenames only show the first 5 characters, making it hard to find anything. The pause/play button does not always work when listening to music. Folder and file navigation is way too slow. The volume on this thing is extremely weak. Video conversion software that is included does not work (winXP & WME9). Seems to me that the manufacturer tried to make it as cheap and as quickly as possible. It's a good idea, it's just that they should have spent more time tweaking it. If you have the money for one of these things, save another $100 and buy a video iPOD.  P.S. - Anyone know if the PVR firmware is linux based?

[title]:some what pleased
[fullText]:I really liked the product stands for, but there were problems that I guess are internal problems with the machine.  I have purchased this device several times and each time there was a different problem with the machine.  After I loaded about 35 movies on the device, it wouldn't cut on.  Once the machine wouldn't cut off, so I had to reset the devise, which I lost all of my movies.  I think if there were more products like this, it could really be a good device, because it was good for travel and you don't have to take a portable DVD player and movies with you.  I really like the devise, it just had too many problems for me.  I would love to have another one, but I have purchased too many and returned too many, so I don't want to keep getting the devise, only to have to return it and keep paying for shipping fees for manufacture problems.

[title]:Interesting toy to play with
[fullText]:I have tried a little of almost everything with this device.  I have played MP3 music; recorded shows and movies from Satellite, VCR, DVD, and other sources; played those recordings on a PC; and stored photos and computer data as if it was an external hard drive.  Everything has worked so far.  On the downside, the earphones created instant static (so I substituted them with a set that I have used with a standalone MP3 player), the device is on the thick side, and the external speakers volume does not turn up high enough to listen to (you need to plug external speakers on the headset output to listen to the music or videos if you do not use a headset).  I like the relatively large screen and it almost offsets the negativity due to the thickness of this device.  You can just plug in this device to a PC and play video and/or music etc by double clicking on the file stored on this PVR   It has been easy to use and fun to play with so far for the first couple of months.

Once the battery fails, it's useless.  You can't replace it.  The only way is to send the entire unit back to Mustek and you're at their mercy as to the price for the battery and shipping costs.  Do you really want to frustrate yourself???????  The only good thing about the unit is the fair video quality.  The sound is tinney, low volume (even on high).  Even though there's no speaker (connect earphones), the San Disk Sansa is the best bang for the buck!

[title]:Look elsewhere, this is a poor-quality mp3 player
[fullText]:While I'm a big fan of Lexar's flash memory cards, this MP3 player is a very poor choice, even though its memory can be expanded via a larger-capacity SD card.  First of all, this player is thick.  Companies like Creative Labs have thin and stylish MP3 players, but this Lexar is thick and unstylish -- you have to see it in person to see what I mean.  It's not really butt-ugly like iRiver players, but still very plain.  Again, it's the thickness that unpleasantly surprised me.  Second, sound quality is TERRIBLE.  The same MP3 files (encoded at 192kbps) that sound great on the iPod sound muffled and colorless on this Lexar.  Worse, there are occasional pop noises that are not present on the iPod or Archos AV320.  This is just terrible.  For this alone, I advise you stay away from this Lexar product.  Third, the buttons are hard to use (esp. when the player is in the cheap clear plastic case) and the screen is hard to see in most lighting situations.  This is simply one of the most user-unfriendly MP3 players I've come across.  Fourth, yes it has built-in FM, but its reception is horrible.  My tiny $5 no-name AM/FM radio gets clear reception here in the office, but the Lexar gets nothing but statics.  I don't think this is because I got a lemon; from what I've read elsewhere, this is a common complaint.  In short, while I'll continue to buy Lexar flash memory, I'll advise anyone not to even think about getting this MP3 player from them.  In fact, if you search on Amazon you'll see their other MP3 players are no good, either.

Simply put, the best MP3 out there, with every feature in players twice as much. Why pay for an I-pod for twice the cost that has no FM radio, no FM transmitter, no expandable memory and is limited on the music files it can download.

It then needs to be reset with a pin (it usually happens on the train when there's no pin  to be found. 2)You can't navigate the music files from the Expansion slot to the Actual players memory. You have to manually set the player If you want to select from the SD card or the players memory. 3)Poor instructions in manual (pdf) included.  4)Hard to navigate the button & options.

[fullText]:I have purchase this player in April because I went to a Wedding to California. It worked and when I bought in April and in May I came back and three (3) months later in July the battery is not holding so I had to call Lexar for a replacement and they did send me a replacement. I got the replacement in August and then guess what happen agian? YES the battery will not hold again. This is ridiculous. I mean the new one is a lemon and the EXCHANGE one is lemon too. Lexar makes cheap cheap cheap things except for memory. The shouldn't make MP3 Players anymore and just stick with making memory. Like the I-PODS and other manufactures who uses a built in rechargeable battery and when the battery dies your screwed. If they say pay $30-60 to replace a battery I rather buy a new MP3. If you get there extended service plans that is crazy you can even but a new one if you get there extended service. Think about about it when you're buying MP3 players. My suggestion is buy an MP3 player that uses batteries like for a walkman or rechargeable batteries for cameras because once they die you can get batteries at a CHEAPER price. I am going to REFUND my money for my player. Don't ever buy from LEXAR or any other compnies that uses built in rechargeable batteries.  Nothing good about this player.  Rechargeable batter (Built in) always dieing every three months. Think about it after the warranty is over what are you going to do with it. You're stuck.

[title]:OK mp3 player for the price
[fullText]:I've had this product for about a year and a half now without any major problems. Some of the other reviewers should check to see if their firmware is updated to vs 1.7 as this fixed several issues with the unit. I have to say that for the price this player performs well. I use it with some Phillips sound reducing headphones and I think it sound pretty good. The fm transmitter is a little weak and the ear buds work as a better antenna than the one that comes with it. Also the menus are not very intuitive but after a while you can navigate them fairly quickly. I'd have to say that for the $60 that I spent I'm pretty happy. It's no ipod but then again it doesn't cost $300 either.

I store a lot of streaming audio, plays, books, radio talks, etc., from the BBC and NPR, and they're great to use on a long car journey.  The player was a refurb and cost me all of $17.00 - gotta be great value, especially with the ability to use a 2GB card. Some people have complained about the sound quality - I wonder if they've discovered the equalizer and WOW sound augmentation system. And I use it with a decent pair of noise cancelling headphones as well, so flights are a breeze.  Only negative so far is those floppy covers for the MP3 and mem card slots.  But for the price, you can't beat it.

[title]:Terrible product. Poorly designed, poorly made, don't buy!!!
[fullText]:My wife owns the Sandisk 256k (red) flash player which is great, so I figured I'd try this one. After all, it's the same company. Plus, it's a 512k flash player plus expansion at virtually the same price as the standard 512k flash player. What a mistake! The standard Sandisk flash player is solidly built, has an intuitive design, easy to use buttons (even if small), a clear bright blue display, and great sound quality (even when using MP3s at 128kbs). The Sansa has none of these virtues. It is incredibly flimsy; the buttons are nearly impossible to use, the battery door is made of tissue thin plastic and constantly falls off, the sound quality is rotten, and once you put the plastic case on you'll never get if off. Further, while the SanDisk MP3 Flash player plays tracks in the order you place them in the player (very efficient), The Sansa seems incapable of playing songs in anything but alphabetical order, a real problem for someone like myself who likes eclectic music: (one track "Paint It Black" by the Stones; next track "The Prophecy" from "The Fellowship of The Rings Soundtrack"!) On top of this my unit was defective. The lock would lock the sound volume only temporarily. Suddenly music would blare out and nearly bust my eardrums; next I could barely hear a thing. Pure garbage. Get the regular Sandisk MP3 Flash player or get an iPod for twice the price and a thousand times the value. This product is pure junk!!!!

[title]:Not great, but works for me.
[fullText]:Tight case and terrible headphones aside, for 81.00 dollars, I was pleased with the product. Using a different pair of headphone I thought the sound quality was good.  I stretched out the case alittle and have no problems there.I generally use mp3 that are 160 or higher so I was pleased with the sound.  A firmware upgrade would make it a better player. I have contacted sandisk about the upgrade. Hope they are listening. Great for playing audible books on tape (you can use the highest quality file format). Transferring all files was quick and easy. I'm using a 512 mg card that I already owned and can fit tons of songs. The sd cards can be found for low prices if you shop around. All in all for the price I am very pleased with the player.

[title]:Not as bad as I thought at first
[fullText]:I still like the their joystick players better, but I need to modify some of my previous comments: 1. The sound quality is pretty good - after you replace the headphones and fiddle with the equalizer and SRS settings. 2. The click wheel for changing volume and settings operates raggedly.  3. It is much clumsier when strapped to your arm than the joystick player. 4.It is extremely difficult to get out of its clear plastic case without damaging the case - but you can correct this by wiping a very fine layer of talcum powder on the inside (got that from a forum).  5.Most annoyingly, whenever you turn it off and back on it forgets all of it's settings.  You have to reset the volume, the equalizer, and the play order - you can correct this by reformatting the flash memory.  It must be formatted in FAT 32.  It comes natively formatted in FAT 16   I'd bump it up to 3.5 stars but they won't let me change that on an edit.

[title]:Simple to use, inexpensive, and good
[fullText]:After reading some of the reviews, I hesitated before buying this.  I've been looking for a flash drive to store more audible files and finally decided to buy this. I haven't had it long but I'm delighted with it.  The player is simple to work without looking at the manual.  It uses only 1 battery. I've replaced the enclosed earplugs with better quality ones and the sound is excellent.      I know some have complained about the wheel.  This is the first player I've had with a wheel and, possibly because of this, I've had no problem with how it feels.  My other flash player is an Iriver which has some additional features but is more complicated to use and far less intuitive.      The player is very light.  There are few parts to break and it seems sturdy. It also comes with a one year warranty.  Most other players I've checked out have a much shorter one.      A final plus is its exapandability.  I've been using a  512mb player for some time and haven't needed more space.  If I ever do, it's nice to know I can add it.  Addendum:  I've been using the player daily.  I still love it and find it easier than my iriver.  There is 1 glitch I've found re auto-resume.  Several times, while listening to an audible book, the player has come on back at the initial index instead of where I left off in the book.  It appears that to auto resume the book I need to press the start button very briefly.  If I press it for several seconds, the player opens at the settings index instead. Those having problems with auto resume might try this.

[fullText]:I have been satisfied with this product. It was simple to load songs on to the player. The operation is very straight forward and easy to understand as well as implement. The ear buds were different than I was previously acquainted with but after a short time, they were comfortable. They also provided an excellent quality of sound reproduction. All in all I am very happy with my purchase and would make this same purchase again if I had the need to do so.

[title]:Nice little player...
[fullText]:Nice mp3 player, gets the job done. The FM tuner is a definite plus. The user navigation is ok. There is an upper right click-wheel is for scrolling and another button on the side to select a menu option, and the buttons on the front for song/radio navigation. Call me spoiled but I've gotten use to the consolidated buttons and menu navigation of my Ipod. I'm more comfortable navigating this with two hands, but that doesn't bother me.  The size is small; it fits in the palm of my hand. I actually like how this player looks. The main reason I got this was because it is flash-based and I can work out with it without worrying about jostling parts. And also because it's expandable. I use it with a 1GB SD card. That's a BIG plus.  Drawbacks are ones that have already been mentioned by other readers, e.g. doesn't have an auto-resume reader, but I don't listen to audiobooks so that's not a big issue for me. One minor annoyance is how the songs are automatically sorted by song name ascending. I know I can rename the songs with a number in the track title like others have mentioned, but that requires more work than I'd like. Also, I haven't figured out how to create a playlist, or if that can even be done. It allows the user to choose from album, artist, songs, and some other options, so I don't think there's a way to make a mix of various songs. If anyone has figured it out, please post it.  Uploading songs is simply enough. Connect the USB cable from player to PC and create folders and just drag and drops songs with Windows Explorer. You can also copy songs off the player back to PC, which is nice.  Battery life is fine with me. I used up the batteries that shipped with this in about a day I think and shortly after got NIMH rechargeable AAAs. If you use this with an external SD card, it's going to consume more battery power...  Headphones are ok; I've never been a fan on the in-ear design though.  The plastic case that came with the player drove me nuts the first week or so. It was skin-tight and I almost ripped the case the first few times trying to get the player out to change the batteries. But now it's loosened up and works fine. I'm withholding a star on this review for lack of belt clip on the case. This might sound minor, but I'm not a fan of the included arm band when working out and so I have to put it in my pocket or hold it. It's small but not ultracompact so a belt clip would have been nice. I haven't found another case that would fit this that includes a belt clip either. If Sandisk offered one, I would purchase it.  And something I found out when I first got it...you need to leave about 4MB of space from the Sandisk 512MB that's included on the player for its software to work. (And note to Sandisk: you have a spelling error on the error message that comes up if there isn't enough space).  Let's see what else...I took the plastic port and SD card covers off, those aren't going to stay on, but no biggie. It also comes with a stopwatch function in the software. I like the Sound Effect and Equalizer features of the software, and that it can also play WMA files. And I don't know if I am the only one experiencing this but sometimes when I listen to the radio, the volume level seems to drop about two levels on its own. It happens rarely though; not yet to the point where it's become an issue.  Overall, I like this player. I looked at various models before deciding on this one because it had both an FM tuner and was expandable. Compared to other players in its price range, the included features are great. I would purchase it again.

[title]:Poor Quality
[fullText]:I was quite disappointed with my purchase.  Cons: 1) I could not figure out how to control the order of the song playing.  It would only play in random or alphabetical order.  I would have to change the file names for all the music files to make sure that the files play in the same order as the CD. 2) The SD slot was practically useless.  I have a 1GB chip and everytime the player powered-up it would spend about 5 minutes examining the files on the SD looking for new files. 3) This is the big one.  I was listening to the player in the car when I dropped it on the carpetted floor - it went dark and has not worked since.  New batteries could not bring it to life.  After spending a hundred on this, I have a dead MP3 player.

[title]:pretty good mp3 player...but it doesnt last too long
[fullText]:i've had this mp3 player for about 2 years now and it's been pretty good. Well it was for about a year anyway. After that the buttons pretty much stopped working. At first, it was just one and then gradually they all stopped working. It really sucks because this is a good mp3 player and it holds all my music but now i cant use it because the buttons dont work. Besides the buttons not working, it also doesnt hold a charge for very long. It lasts for about 4 hours until it dies. If you want a mp3 player that lasts long and is durable then you should probably keep looking because this definitly doesnt. But it was good while it lasted =/

[title]:One of the worst MP3 players ever made
[fullText]:I'm a big techno-geek, but this is been one of the most awkward, horrible experiences I've had trying to get this device to do the simplist things. The application to get your MP3s on this is not user friendly, not intuitive. It's like it's strived to be so different from the ipod that it took out all of the good and left the bad. The player doesn't even register half the time with my computer. It takes a good half hour of messing around with the device and the settings to get it to work. I plug in the Ipod and it takes maybe 30 seconds. 1 minute tops.  Save your money. Save your aggravation. Get something, anything else.

[fullText]:Really happy with the Zen Micro.  I am using it with Napster To Go and have am thrilled.  The playback sound is great (with smart volume on) and it looks cool.    A few gripes: - As a previous reviewer stated, the battery life was short at first, but after a couple full discharges - I'm getting at least 10 hours of music per charge. - The touchpad is WAY TOO SENSITIVE!  I have to lock it when I do not want to use the controls (and its on low sensitivity). - No accessories.  I can't find a holster/clip for this thing for use when exercising.  You'd think there would be tons out there....go figure. - Creative Media software is marginal. - it's the same toilet-white as an iPod on the sides and back.  All things being equal, I'd buy it again.

[title]:Zen MP3 player sounds great
[fullText]:I'm new to MP3 players so I'm still working out how to transfer and arrage the files.  I say "files" rather than music because I'm more interested in recorded books and podcasts than music. Music does sound GREAT using the earphones that came with it - and the books sound great, too, but it's still a trial and error process getting all tracks of all discs of a book in order.  That will take a little more practice on my part.  The touchpad also took a little getting used to, but I was able to master it in a day or two. I was not happy when I realized that the only way provided to charge it was by hooking it up to the computer USB port.  That means you have to take your computer on the road with you.  No wall outlet or auto adapter was provided. All in all I'm pleased with this purchase - and I suspect I'll like it better after I've had some time to figure out how to arrange the files or playlists.

[title]:Best Value in the Land of Un-iPOD
[fullText]:The Zen Micro is near perfect.    I bought my Zen Micro last december as a christmas gift to myself, save for a few software issues, I couldn't be happier with my purhcase.    I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips.  It's been in my pocket, in my car, and in my bag in 20 inches of snow and 100 degree summers.  It's been dropped, shuffled, kicked, and Lumbered.  It's still alive, still kicking, and still playing.   I've never owned an Ipod, so this won't be a which one is better review.    All of my files are mp3 or wma, Windows Media Player is my primary music suite, i use it to burn, play, rip, and sync.  So starting out i knew i wanted a windows friendly player.  The Zen Micro (mine's black) has a lot going for it.    It fits into a hand well, it has a removable battery (this is important), great sound quality, fm stereo, recorder, smooth UI, and a feature that most unipods lack... charm.  When it's being used or charged it emits a low pulsating blue light.    It's doesn't have a scroll wheel, but it has a strip!  Most people complain about the sensitivity, but it can easily be adjusted for personal preference.    My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy.  It wouldn't always work seemlessly with WMP and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it.  over and over again.  But after a few firmware releases it's working without a hitch.  I've programed WMP to throw a few favorites on there all the time and always put my new music (less than 3 months) on so I can listen to them in the gym.   The accesories that come with the player are great.  White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.  Also all the required cables and what not.  To me, currently at $218, this player is a best in class.  It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.    Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.    Pick your favorite color and buy it.

[title]:good so far
[fullText]:I've had this player for a little more than 4 hrs and from what i can see so far, it has alot of great things about it. At first i was like i dont know if i can get used to the touch pad and i eventually did. I plugged it in and after a fairly long install and a restart, i started loading songs onto it using the nice media organizer program. For the people that want to know how big it is, it fits very nicely into a standard pack of altoids. Or dimensions 3in. x 2in. x 3/4in. sorry metric people. One thing i must mention is the great sound quality. Before this player, i bought the Samsung blue square looking one, 512mb and i was not impressed so far as sound and navagation. Speaking of navigation, the buttons are layed out very nice. I dont use the drop down menu button very much. The menus all are easy to navigate. The radio is decent, and the recorder is O.K. also.   PROS  +STYLE +TOUCH PAD +AUDIO +GOOD EARBUDS +REMOVABLE BATTERY +MORE SPACE THAN IPODMINI +FITS EASILY IN HAND +ENTERTAINING BLUE GLOW  CONS -SOFTWARE COULD BE BETTER -HARD DRIVE BASED (POTENTIAL PROBLEMS?)  All in all, if you are looking for a good player, but dont want a mini then get the ZEN MICRO

[title]:IPOD Killer
[fullText]:This mp3 player is awesome. I have nothing bad to say about it. The software is extremely easy to use. The only problem I have is trying to navigate the menu in the car (which I shouldn't be doing anyway) and really isn't the players fault I guess. One other thing is it only has a 3 bar battery monitor so when one bar is left you could have 10 mins or up to 8 hrs. Other than that though it is perfect. After using my brother's IPOD for a month prior to getting this, the Micro is preferable in many ways (most important to me is ease of use and it is considerably smaller).

[title]:WATCH OUT!!!  I am very serious!
[fullText]:I bought the Rocket MP3 player from Musician's Friend and was very excited at first.  I also bought a 1 year warranty on the player.  I personally hate this product and the company who sold it to me  (E-Blitz).  The reason why is because after I downloaded music into the player, for some reason it wouldn't play for nothing!!! I got extremely frustrated from having to constantly restart my comp. because it froze many times for no reason! Every time I tried to play the music that was downloaded into the player, the screen would just display "00" or "01" and nothing happened! Then, after many nervewrecking times of plugging in the USB, it stated that there was an error. It said that there was not enough memory in the player to play, therefore I couldn't use it at all.  Apparently, the player couln't handle the MEASLY 3 or 4 songs that were downloaded into it!!!(that is WACK!) How should have I known when to stop downloading songs! The thing was useless! And if I buy more memory, how do I know it won't do the same thing when the memory runs out?! I tried to call the company for a trade or refund, but all they told me was to call another # back and forth! Even with the warranty, I was not helped at all. I couldn't do anything! I wasted my money (...) for something that doesn't even work! If I could, I would warn everybody not to buy this product because if it happened to me, it could happen to you! I believe nobody should be RIPPED OFF like I was! I think that this product shouldn't be advertised at all because it is screwed up!!! (...)

Lets go on to compare them. the  ipod mini is a so called legend but i dont think so cause first of all it only has 4 gig compared to the carbon and the mini which have 5 thats 25% more. then the carbon and the creative mini have a voice recorder and the creative mini has a fm radio and a recorder. The ipod mini has a touch pad which the creative mini also has. The carbon does not have this but has an auto dj that chooses your favorite songs and your least favorites. the ipod mini does not have this but the creative one does. Like the adress book and such in the ipod mini not to fear the creative one has those too.the carbon does't. Both minis also feature backlit buttons. But the creative mini also has a cool light on the edge of player. carbon doesn't. Plus the ipod mini cant play wma the others can. Plus on the creative mini the touch pad is not  circle and has no buttons on it. Now lets name what all have. Creative has fm radio and recorder,voicerecorder, adress book and such, backlit buttons, touch pad, auto dj, 10 colors. the rio carbon has 5 gb , voice recorder, auto dj, extremely small.The ipod mini has 4 gb, no fm, no voice rrecorder, adressbook and such, .

On that basis it would seem that you are an Apple employee, next time do not open your mouth. As for me i think that this product is far better than the apple ipod mini although for it to take down the mini it must have a crack team of marketers to get the word out, other wise it will likely go unnoticed. For all those un biased about products you should find this a much better product than the ipod mini on many fronts.  NEW: It seems that amazon in an attempt to make a few more bucks has jacked the price up from the 250$ that it used to be to 280$. Dont buy here go to creatives web site and buy from them its cheaper and you wont get screwed by amazon. I still love this product and intend to buy it after a few reviews come out from respectable magazines like PCmag or someone like that but until then screw you amazon i hate you and you need to drop the price back down so this thing can compete with the ipod mini.

[title]:Zip it!
[fullText]:I've had my first Creative player, the Zen Xtra 60GB for 5 months now and I must say that I am incredibly happy with it.  I don't think that "Zip" is actually an Apple employee but worse yet a Mac geek (see book, "Cult of Mac").  The most ridiculous argument made by these types is with regard to the sound quality.  The ipod and ipod mini do most certainly have worse sound quality than just about any of their competitors.  Not only have I tested this myself, but anyone can read professional reviews and ratings for these players, where the apple inferiority in sound quality is always noted).  I just read a consumer reports roundup (either nov or oct 2004) of HD digital audio players and the ipod and ipod mini were each the WORST of their respective categories in sound quality.    I don't own it myself, but have a friend who does and can tell you that the Iriver ihp series absolutely blows away the ipod in many aspects, including sound quality.     As for this "imitator" label, lets all remember that apple was not even the second company to come out with this type of device (hard drive based digital audio player).  Creative was indeed the first with the Nomad. I owned an Archos jukebox well before the ipod was released (that model even has better sound quality than the ipod).  The ipod certainly was the smallest when it came out and continues to have a great interface but others have caught up.  Apple is actually the imitator in this regard although this is not well known becuase apple has the greater geek fanbase and marketing muscle to help obscure things.  Most people are not even aware that competing products exist.  What is apalling though, is that the advertising and the apple fanboy base have gone so far as to claim that the ipod has better sound quality.  I'm not just expressing my opinion, standards for measurement of sound quality exist and Apple's ipod's and ipod mini's do not compare favorably against the competition in this regard (do some research on Google, even on your mac).  Creative is the standard in computer audio hardware (the core elements of a digital audio player) and this helps them produce players with great sound.    No, I do not own a Zen micro and have never written a review for anything before owning the very item.  I was forced to do so here after noticing the utter insanity of Zip's comments.  If you want to just load up your player with Justin Timberlake, Creed or Brittney songs off of ITunes, perhaps the ipod is your best bet, just quit lecturing others.  Also, the backlit screen will reduce the battery life for any player, and the zen touch's battery life still kills that of the ipod (if you actually did own one).    Please, zip it good!

[fullText]:The Zen Micro looks great to me, better than the iPod mini and equal to the Rio Carbon.  Pros: +5 GB Seagate drive +Great sound quality (all of Creative's players) +Synchs with Outlook +Looks cool +Removable battery  Cons: -Requires software to transfer music -No tactile buttons, all touch sensitive.   And to the fool zip, iRiver was out before the iPod, so your point is moot.

[title]:Interesting design
[fullText]:I really like this "curved" design, and the electric blue glow is cool (can't wait to play with it under the sheets with my girlfriend). Have to remark to Gadgester about "Creative should hire some real industrial designers." that  J.Ive's worked on toilets and wash basins before iPod, which probably explains the white of the original iPod and the metallic colors of the mini, they all remind me of public toilets. The beltclip on Mini is really useless (unless you have small private parts and need to show your Mini off to impress the girls - "look see girls, I spent wads of money girls, do you like me now?) The curved shape of Micro plus its smaller size will make it easy to slip anywhere, Mini was uncomfortable in my pocket, all those sharp edges sticking in me. Good to see Microsoft and Creative team up with this product so that it will work on any PC running Windows. Think I'll leave iPods for the people who spend money to look cool, and get myself a Zen Micro as I value my music quality above what my friends think of me.

[title]:Missing OGG sopport
[fullText]:I'm writing this review because I'm been loocking forward to the iPod competition... but it is constantly letting me down. Why does creative incorporated FM radio and not ogg sopport first?, being this a digital music player... I think the are just trying to battle  the iPod with the same features, not really trying to make a better player. There are far too few ogg players out there, and most of them are not good or too expensive...

[title]:Lotta Bang for the Buck
[fullText]:I could type all day about the knitpicky waa waa of iPods and Zen players, but what it boils down to is simple, really.  The new series of Zen players are well worth the coin; they're functional; they look good; they sound fantastic, and they cost less than an iPod.  Bottom line.  But hey - buy an iPod if you want - Steve Jobs is the laughing all the way to the bank.   For the record, it was Creative that invented the portable music player, but it was Apple that created something unique with the concept and put marketing muscle behind it.  If you want to be specific, you could say that the iPod is actually an expensive knockoff of the of the older circa 1999 players - yes 1999!  Was there an iPod back then?  Nope.

[title]:Good idea, doesn't quite come through
[fullText]:This flash drive seemed like a great idea.  Unfortunatly, the player has trouble playing most of the music files I transfer to it from my iBook.  The company says its compatible with Apple computers, but normally the player will only play a handful of the songs I transfer to it!

[title]:Item okay, but I'm no techno wiz...
[fullText]:The item is okay for the purpose I intend to use it.  I've downloaded about 3 1/2 hours worth of music that I listen to on my pc at work, or when I exercise.  I have not used the voice recording function except to make sure it works, which I plan to use in classes.  Downside is that it does seem to "lock up" a lot, and I have to remove the battery to shut it down in order to start over.

[title]:a mix of good and bad
[fullText]:Picked this mp3 player up simply because it had a low price, and I wanted a player to use while exercising.  I had never heard of Coby so I wasn't sure what I was in for...  The good:  Easy to set-up and use right out of the package--didn't even have to install anything.  Simpy drag and drop mp3's from Itunes into the "portable device" icon.  This player is pretty small so you can use it virtually anywhere.  Runs on one AAA battery.  Decent little lcd display that so far only shows the song title.  From what I gather there are several options you can use, such as playlists, repeat, etc.  Have only had it one day so I haven't gotten into all that just yet.  The bad:  Seems a little flimsy...not sure how long this thing will hold up.  Function buttons and overall unit have a "dollar store" feel to them, kinda like a cheap toy out of a cereal box.  The ear buds included in the box are junk.  I guess you get what you pay for...maybe it will work for years on end but somehow I doubt it.  Probably would be wise to invest more money into your mp3 player purchase and get something with a longer shelf life.  Also, it is worth mentioning that the instruction booklet for this item is a joke.

[title]:You get what you pay for
[fullText]:Basically this is a cheap item that should not be purchased. You can spend a little more and get a nicer and better equipped item. I bought this for my young daughter to download only minimal amounts of music so I thought for the price, this would be fine. However, it simply would not download songs. It continually 'locked up'. When it would finally download, the ear piece had static throughout. Finally, upon downloading  one CD, you were forced to erase that CD to download another. I have sent this back to the manufacturer for a refund. Upon telling the salesperson about my reasoning for returning the product, there was no questions. This is probably commonplace for this product.

[title]:The Best Cheap Mp3 player  for  MAC or PC
[fullText]:I had this for 1 1/2 years.  I am a MAC person.  So I wanted the cheapest MAC compatible player out there. IT WORKS EXCELLENT!! For both types! No reformating of the drive, you stick in a MAC it reads it or stick in a PC it reads it. You can't use Itunes with it but the software in the box works fine. It does the job. You get what you pay for which is true.  Simple to use and drag and drop and your done.  I use this for work as well (transport files). TIP: if does fail go to the website and get the FIRMWARE UPDATE.  I had mine freeze up b/c I snatch it right out of the port rushing to meet an appointment. I got the update and it works again, Great! PS I have a NanoPod too, this is COBY player is still a great value.

[title]:junk
[fullText]:This thing didn't last long at all.  First month worked fine.  Second month, the files started to randomly get shuffled into other files.  Third month, the folder files were unable to be deleted off the player, and the screen gave foreign jargon instead of english, so I had to remember how to get to menu items by counting 'clicks' and 'ups and downs'.  Fourth month, the screen went out.  Bottom line, stick with a proven technology leader like Sandisk, who have been making quality flashdrives for years.  I've got one of their players and have had not one problem for nearly a year.

[fullText]:Hardware awesome, software a flop. Since you HAVE to use their software the package is destroyed. I will give you the final nail on the coffin for me. I tried to put Podcasts on the device using the latest SonicStage 4. No chance. It wants to be able to find each "artist" in the Sony library. This was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library.  I had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend - no chance now. Shame as the hardware was A1.

[title]:Stylish, easy to use, efficient battery 
[fullText]:Super fast shipping from Sony. I got mine for $79, I don't know why they raised the price. Anyway I've had mine for a few days now and I'm completely satisfied, didn't have to read the manual, for me it was as simple as any CD player or walkman.  However, like most other people I did have some issues with the SonicStage software not accepting some of your files, but I just figured that all you need to do is convert your files to .wav Instead of .mp3 before you add them.  Look: comes in lots of cool shades, I liked the design much better than the ipod.  Battery: this mp3 player is supposed to have some kind of technology that allows you to enjoy hours and hours of listening time before having to recharge, which still takes a few minutes. I left mine on accidentally all night yesterday, and woke up with it still running, with more than 3/4 full battery.  The only other con I would say are the very awkward headphones, the right piece is twice as long as the left, but you can always get replacements.  Other than that, I'm very satisfied with my purchase.

[title]:Good Quality product, but may need getting used to
[fullText]:I initially was hesitant of buying "a" sony MP3 player based on all the other reviews. I will have to say getting used to the SonicStage program can take time. Some mp3 files might prove problematic to play on it (a couple of my files did not play on it). But converting to the OMG format and using those files really is not that big of a deal. It will take a bit of time, but you really have to do it once. The sound quality (earphones + playback) is just great. Moreover it is just beautiful. I have to say the OLED display is wonderful, and going through playlists and the like is with no problem. Long story short, it is "different" from other mp3 players because of no drag and play, but in my humble opinion it is not a deal breaker.

So that sucked but other than that, I love my sony mp3 player.   Must Buy!!!!

[fullText]:This mp3 player is very confusing. They don't put any instructions in the box either. You have to download them, and it's almost 100 pages long. Who has time to read all of that? I've had my mp3 player for over a month and i still haven't put any songs on it. Well I had like 3, but I hit a button (trying to skip to the next song)and it erased them all. So it's easy to erase your songs without knowing it. When I first downloaded the songs, I was trying to play the next song and i hit the button and it just repeated the same song over and over again. VERY CONFUSING!

[fullText]:I've purchesed this item little more than a week ago (mostly because it was cheap). I have to say it works great, and even though everyone said not to use the software it comes with, I gave it a try. I don't know why people don't like it, it's very simple and easy to use. I'm not a comp. wiz, and still I set up the whole thing in no time with my fav music-also with the 5 free downloads it comes with, too. So for this cheap, it's a great deal. The earpiece of course is useless, but I've got great ones also from sony, so didn't care. So thanx Etronic!   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008JFCVU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-3686616-6018308">Sony NW-E505 Network Walkman 512 MB Digital Music Player with FM Tuner Pink</a>

[title]:Great for working out
[fullText]:I purchased this item over 6 months ago and it's perfect for the gym. I've dropped it on several occasions and a couple of times in the water fountain. It still works like a charm. I am very very hard on electrical equipment when I work out. The down side is that you have to really get your music from Sonic Stage, which isn't great. You have to down load music into it and then down load it to your player. Other devises you go from the cd right to your player. It takes a bit longer than necessary. The other problem is if you lose that clip devise that holds the player to your clothes while your work out, it can't be replaced. So don't loose it!  The positives are that it holds a charge for a long time. I work out 5 days a week, 2 hours a day. I have to charge it once every month...maybe.  It also has plenty of memory and it can hold a lot of music. It's well worth it. It's really better than a disc-man and it's not complicated to use.

[title]:NWE 505 a questionable package
[fullText]:I purchased this item to listen to FM radio or music while running.  The wire for the ear buds are incredibly short, and so I clipped the unit to the collar of my tee shirt.  Sweat got on the case and the thing quit working within 30 minutes.  This seemed like a fluke, since the device seems to be made for working out, so I returned it to Sony.  At first Sony refused to repair or replace the unit, and wanted to refund the purchase price.  I refused and they shipped another unit, which quit working in a similarly short period of time under similar circumstances.  At this point I gave up.  Visiting my local Radio Shack later for another reason, I found that an FM radio with a two gig MP3 player (the NWE 505 has 512M) was available for about $40, cheaper than the NWE 505, without waiting for delivery.  Works great, without the hassle of the Sony MP3 software.

However, I have noticed that it now does not hold its charge as long, or it doesn't charge up all the way.  I do not do any exercising activities with it, so I have never had the moisture under the screen problem and it has help up very well in the past two years that I have owned it.  However, I started to feel the annoyance of the fact that you cannot fast forward or rewind songs.  Also, you can't just push a button to go the the next song.  I have to go to the main menu, go into the albums, find the album, and scroll down to find the next song that I want.  Other than these small annoyances, it works great!

[title]:Great MP3 player!
[fullText]:I love this MP3 player.  The reason I picked this MP3 player over all the others is because it is small and it has an FM Tuner.  In the winter when I have to exercise inside the gym has televisions with FM transmitters to listen to them.  If I didn't have the FM tuner I would be able to listen to the televisions and it gets old after a while if you can only listen to straight music.  It is also nice to listen to a local station to get the local news and events that are going on.  The only downfall on this item is the display is difficult to see out in the sun.  Battery life is super long and it charges up fast if you forget to charge it up.  It really does last 3 hours with a 3 minute charge.

[title]:if you don't want video or your whole music library with you.....
[fullText]:I've had this little mp3 player for over a year now, bought one for my wife, and my brother loved it (bought one too). It's about the size of a lighter, light weight, and comes with a clip that actually works well. You got to spend a little bit of time to figure out the controls, especially if you're just trying to figure it out on your own, you might not notice the shuffle control. A tiny little button on the back side of the player.   Battery time is awesome, there's just nothing else to that.  The moisture thing is true... I just started to notice it about a month ago. A small part of the screen is starting to have a little cloudy spot on it.  But after over a year of using it on my runs and workouts, and all of my travels, I cannot complain.   I had bought a zune which was huge, then an ipod (not as big, but still bothered me on my runs). Then I realized that I don't need my whole music library with me at all times, so one gig is perfect for me.  If you purchase a good set of headsets... this player will deliver a good sound, great battery time, and plenty of music (you can use the atrac formatting from sony).

[title]:Don't even accept one for free as a gift--(0 stars)
[fullText]:functionality of device itself is good but the software you HAVE to use is terrible.  Why can't it just be drag and drop through windohs explorer?  I just don't understand proprietary third party software.  I bought a Sony cd mp3 player a couple years ago, installed the software and almost immediately uninstalled it because it was so bad and just made mp3 cds with whatever burning software I had--couldn't have been happier that way. In my experience Sony software is far less than functional and is to be avoided and here you are not given the option to not use it unless you just want to use you player as an expensive 1G storage drive.  That alone makes it not worth buying.  Stick with players that are open source.  As for the authorization thing to get files off the player?  I wish there was an option here to give less than one star on the review.  Player sounded good though and didn't have cosmetic problems some note before I returned it.

[title]:Almost perfect
[fullText]:For every one of you who is looking for a way to transfer MP3 files directly to this player (or any other newer NW-EXXX models) follow the link below and download Sony MP3 file manager V2.0: http://www.sonydigital-link.com/DNA/common/asp/details.asp?l=en&v=mp3installer_2_0&m=mp3  You need to install the drivers first so that the Windows would recognize the device. You don't need SonicStage if you use this software to play MP3 files. All you do is to run an executable through MP3FM folder inside the player and drag & drop your MP3 files. Unfortunately I could not find a way to combine/rename folders after the transfer. Even if you organize your mp3 files into folders as you want to access in the player beforehand, after running this software your folder structure will be gone if it's deeper than 1 level.  Apart from this the player sounds very good with an awesome display. VBR (variable bit rate) MP3 files are recognized and played back flawlessly. The track/album access with the dial is also designed very well. On the negative side the player feels a bit too plasticky, not like the earlier titanium NW-MS70D. Also the bag that comes with this player is too big for the player itself. I wish there was a smaller one bundled in.

[title]:*SIGH* oh Sony! When will you get it right?
[fullText]:I loved this player.  I thought it was beautiful and it complemented my PSP quite well.    But you know of course that Sony had to mess it up.  Have they not learned anything from the ATRAC only Network Walkman debacle of a few years ago?    See here is what has happened.  Sony is composed of two companies.  Media and Engineers.  The engineers put out all the cool stuff like Plasma TV's, PSP, PS2 (PS3!), etc.  Media puts out cool stuff like Spiderman 1 & 2 and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  Media side thinks EVERYONE is a thief and makes the engineering side put all kinds of stupid restrictions on their hardware.  Like on my PSP I have to rename .mp4 movies to NV25349.mp4 and place them in a folder called NV0001.  Music and pictures go in *gasp* the music and pictures folder!  Anyway this isn't a PSP review.  I got this MP3 player from Amazon and I was so happy when I got it.  I immediately unpacked it, marveled and drooled at how beautiful it is, and hooked it up to my USB port on my computer.  I then tried to copy over MP3's.  Alas that didn't work.  No I had to use this program that was REALLY lame.  It is very restrictive on what you can copy over and, like a previous reviewer said, you have to authenticate to even pull your mp3's off!  IT's MY MUSIC Sony.  I own all the CD's and you're treating me like I stole your baby's college fund.  Come on and wise up.  You didn't get where you are today by restricting your customers and your own innovation.  This could be such an iPod killer but alas restrictive software (even moreso than iTunes!) doesn't help me out.  I sold this player on eBay for more than I bought it for anyway.

[title]:love it!
[fullText]:Has a great look, very modern & sleek!  The screen is really neat, but it's hard to see when using outdoors in the bright sun.  Love how compact it is, how light it is, and how the small number of buttons and things do so many different things.  I do wish there was a arm band for it, but I have concocted my own using a wrist band (sweat band thing) which works fine. It has great sound - I love the various sound options!   One thing I don't like... there are different screen settings, and when you switch one to show the time or something, I wish it would show the music information when you switch songs, but it doesn't.  If you select the time to be shown, you'll see that only until you switch over to the other Display mode.   I have had some problems w/ the software... but I got songs onto the player in the end.  It's not too user friendly.   But overall, I am thoroughly enjoying it.

[fullText]:Sony has a winner here!  Display is crisp and is easily seen in daylight. The Controls are easy to use and straight forward. The size and weight are minimal - you can clip in on your shirt. The sound quality is excellent - even at max sound level. The included sofware is fairly easy to use and setup. It would have been nice (hint to sony) if a standard retractable USB connector was built in - I just bought a mini-usb to USB adapter and keep in in the included bag. The FM tuner is sensitive and locks in the toughest stations. If you carefully look on the web, there is an alternate mp3 manager available that is tiny and can be run directly from the unit when plugged into USB.  The unit can also be used as a file storage device similar to a standard USB dongle.  Battery life is excellent.  Just plug into any USB to recharge.   5 Stars  Awesome!

[title]:Ipod Killer
[fullText]:Sony's NW-E507 Digital Music Player is perfection. The player's benefits range from its sexy design to it's user friendly downloading software. I had searched for a MP3 for several months and upon finding the NW-E507 I knew I had an MP3 Player to rival my friends Ipods. First the NW-E507 holds 1gb of storage which is perfect for what I use it for. My mp3 player is used for the gym mainly. I knew in my mind that the ipod was to big for the gym and the shuffle did not have a screen which was a definite negative. the sony mp3 player has a integrated screen, which has received several compliments. The quick battery charge is great as well and so is the navagational system on MP3 player. Not a single negative i can think of. just buy it.

[title]:Sony's software
[fullText]:It is a well established truism that Sony's primary operating software for their mp3 players is dreadful.  However, they have had the foresight to make available a drag-n-drop "mp3 Manager" that is ingenious in its utter simplicity. (Makes you wonder why they just don't tweak their miserable Sonic software that is both user-un-friendly and, apparently, hyper-suspicious re piracy concerns.)  I have found the MP3 Manager software not only at the Sony site but at a couple other places online.  Once installed, it automatically opens when you connect your player via USB, and opens a window that permits you to delete and add music files with the greatest of ease.  Note, though, it will only work with mp3 formatted files, and won't abide, e.g., wma format.  I have not yet received my NW-E507 (but give it 4 stars based on my experience with the NW-E75 I currently own), but the software works quite well with my NW-E75 (of which I am replacing with the NW-E507 only for the greater 1 gig v. 256MB storage capacity).  I assume, based on a couple postings here, that the MP3 Manager Software works equally as well with the NW-E507 (assume and hope....).

[title]:Poor substitute
[fullText]:This was my second RIO MP3 player, the first worked fine but had a very limited memory.  The carbon worked well for about 1 month.  Then an error started to show up which prompted me to 'reinstall' the system to my computer and uplink all the songs again.  By the third month the player wouldn't link to the computer at all.  After numerous conversations with RIO, they informed me that my player needed to be replaced and offered to send me a replacement for the low low price of $100.  As I payed just $150 on sale 3 months ago, I politely (!@$# NO) declined.  My IPOD nano works well everytime, is smaller, more user friendly, and has a 1 year warrantee vs. the 90days for the RIO.  In otherwords, don't buy the carbon.

[title]:Worked great for 1 month/horrible customer service
[fullText]:I've owned two previous Rio's that I really liked and were adopted by my kids.  I upgraded to the Carbon.  It worked great for one month then required that I format the hard drive every time I wanted to add/delete music.  By month two the "permanent" long life battery was dead.  I followed the exact instructions on Rio's website for warranty assistance--THREE times and was completely ignored.

[title]:DONT BUY RIO
[fullText]:I wish someone had wrote this review before I had bought my Rio carbon(2 for that matter.) I purchased my Rio carbon around Xmas of 2004.  Having used it for almost a year with no complaints I dropped it.  Im not a clumsy person but using it everyday scrolling between songs after song It would move in and out my pocket repeatedly.  As you can guess the volume and song scroll wheel got jammed in.  This delicate piece does not take much effort to destroy.  So I decided to be extremely careful and buy the Rio carbon pearl(6GB).  Again it worked perfectly for a little bit over a year and then suddenly it didn't work.  After restarting the unit more than a dozen times it worked again but did not read the songs I had on the mp3.  Rio customer service said they did not know what was wrong, but I had another 2 or 3 Mb of storage left.  Now 2 months later my Rio completely kunked out and I never drop the unit once!!! I hate Apple and ipod because everybody had one and I didn't want pay more for an ipod mini which at the time had less storage space for around the same price. But now I know why people pay more for things: Qaulity. A brand new Rio carbon cost 114 dollars now as listed on Amazon; but if you are ok with it having problems within a year, then this is the mp3 4 u.

[title]:It's alright
[fullText]:I bought this player like a year and half ago.  For the most part it has worked great.  The price was really affordable for the amount of storage capacity.  I do have to say that I have had an issue with my player though.  A few months past it up and died on me.  I used it until the battery died and when I plugged it in for charging it just wouldn't.  It couldn't turn on or off, it just stopped working.  I threw it in a drawer and started shopping for and ipod.  A couple of days later I decided to give it another shot and I plugged it in to charge and it worked, it charged itself and started working again.  Now, the date and time were way off and I have noticed that it does that sometimes.  You know, the date will be like 5/12/06 and the player will say its 2/15/70, which I don't know why it does that but it doesn't interfere with anything  else. Now, I agree that the customer support for Rio sucks.  When I had issues with mine I tried to call them up and all I kept getting was a machine and that was after they told me that they had a new number.  When I tried going online for support it wasn't much help either and the only thing that I could do was pay them money to see if they could even help me. So overall, its a decent player for the money you are paying.  When its time to get another one I would say that I will most likely not go back to Rio.  I will probably go with something that if I have technical issues they will either help me out or replace mine.  I know that technical difficulties sometimes happen but it doesn't hurt to have a company that at least pretends to care and help you.

[title]: A good buy , when it works properly
[fullText]:I purchased this item and found after spending a few hours of downloading songs, that it was defective. I was disappointed because I was looking forward to getting this item.I contacted your customer service dept and was given instructions on returns,your return process is very efficient and I received a 2nd MP3. The only problem is up to this point it was about 3 weeks from when I originally ordered the item. After spending another 2 hours or so downloading and listening to songs I discovered that this MP3 also was slightly defective also. When listening to songs, only on certain songs, it would lock up and the whole system would just shut off. I did not want to go through another return process and downloading session and I really like this MP3 so even though it is defective,I decided to keep it anyway. I also want you to know that when purchasing the item, I saw no indication on the screen of your website where it said that it was a remanufactured item. I only discovered it after the purchase.

[title]:Not durable, bad customer service, overall unreliable
[fullText]:I've owned this Rio Carbon for about two years. The interface with various Windows versions (I've gone through several since buying this) is very poor, the actual software program that comes with this Rio is rudimentary and that is almost a compliment. The unit itself is prone to fits of all kinds including restarting without reason, not shutting off, taking very long to turn on, etc. For any problems that you may encounter, don't count too much on the Customer Service. It's free only for the first 90 days and even during that time, it's pretty much useless. There is not much else that they can tell you that is not already written on their website which is meant to say, the several serious problems that this player encounters point in only one direction - it is, by nature, unreliable. Avoid it! There are much better options out there these days.

[fullText]:Most of the good reviews I have seen were from people who just bought this MP3 player.  If you notice the on,off and volume switches on the top, they are plastic.  It looks like metal but they are not.  You can only bend or press plastic too many times before it breaks off.  I called the company about this and they wanted $99 to fix it.  Anyone knows you can't press on a plastic piece over and over again.  They told me tough luck.  Sure it was nice for the first week but who cares if its inoperable in a month!

[fullText]:I purchased one of these refurbished Rio players as an introduction to protable MP3 - I loved this thing for the first ccouple of months - great sound, ample storage, nice interface.  Then it started to fall apart - first the volume dial got stuck, then the buttons stopped responding.  The 'push and turn' style of the volume knob is a very poor design that doesn't work and is prone to breakage. Don't be inticed by the low price and ample storage - this thing won't last more than a few months, and there are lots of better options out there now as every consumer electronics manufacturer has jumped into this market.

[title]:I have one of the first ones made
[fullText]:I bought a Rio Carbon when it first came out.  I have the problem with the annoying ear phone plug, but I have been using this Rio daily for years and other than the ear phone plug have never had a problem, never had a piece break, everything works the same as when I first bought it, except it doesn't last for 20 hours on a charge anymore.  I listen to audiobooks when I am running, cleaning house, etc.  I have dropped it a million times, found it in the bottom of my purse, exposed it to heat and cold, and it has never let me down.  I wish they still made RIO's!  I know I have had it at least 3 years.  My daughter has one, two co-workers have one, and my husband's co-worker has one and none of them have ever experienced any problems.  I like the charger, too.  The cable has a usb end and it can plug into the computer or into the ac adaptor.  It makes it convenient when traveling, plus you don't have to have a computer handy to charge the player.

[title]:Save your money. Buy something else-Any Thing!
[fullText]:** Your review of "Rio Carbon 5 GB MP3 Player" **  Sure its cute and fun for the first few hours as stated by other  reviewers. But then there are the problems:  (1) The all important volume control/scroll wheel breaks off if  handled too roughly leaving you with no other means to control the  volume - annoying beyond belief. Given that this wheel also doubles  as a menu selection device/mice you are not going to be able to  change the settings that easily either.   (2) For reasons yet to be discovered, the device goes into an  upgrader mode. Meaning - it displays the message "upgrader" - its  expecting you to upgrade the firmware. But your computer can no  longer recognize it - hence, no upgrade possible and you cannot exit  this mode = IT DOES NOT WORK.  You can't even look at the time at  this point.   (3) Tech support from Rio - ELUSIVE/HARD TO REACH. I don't think  they exist.  (4) Warranty - 90 days after which everything seems to fall apart.  800 number? Forget about it.   Save your money and invest in a more durable device, this thing is  NOT worth it. I became so frustrated with it that I dumped it into  the garbage. I will never buy another MP3 Player from Rio again/EVER!  ** End of the review **

[title]:Decent, but not fabulous
[fullText]:This items works well in general and was a good buy for the price range, but doesn't have the perks that other mp3's have.  You cannot see all of the songs in the playlist when you have selected a list, but only see them as they play.  Also some loose connections at the audio port, making alot of noise when the unit moves, which can be very irritating, especially if you use the unit when exercising/running.

[title]:NO RESUME!!!
[fullText]:The title says it all.  If you bought this player for listening to audiobooks, which is what I did, you'll be extremely disappointed that you'll have to fast forward through the book every time you start it up since there is no resume feature.  Considering audiobooks are anywhere from 3 to 8 hours long in most cases, or at least the pieces you get from audible are, it's totally inconvenient to start playing from the beginning each time you turn it on.  Get used to the fast forward button and remembering exactly what time you were at because you're going to be doing a lot of it.  Lame.

[title]:Progressively Worse
[fullText]:At first I thought it was a pretty nice little MP3 player, although the 60 songs it holds has always been a thorn in my side. I didn't mind converting everthing over to real player since it doesn't play itunes, however, after about three months I had to change the battery...After changing the battery, the mp3 player would randomly shut off, which became a constant problem after every battery change, though eventually the problem would solve itself. Approximately a year later, the battery cover was also constantly falling off for no apparent reason. Now, about a year and a half since purchase, it has completely died, only playing about two minutes worth before shutting off on its own and refusing to reboot for several minutes. It's a great player for the price, but I would have liked something a little more dependable with a larger memory.

[title]:Don't buy this piece of junk
[fullText]:Worked pretty well for the first month except that there is no way that I could find to bookmark the books I was listening to.  At one month, though, the cheap belt-clip broke off while I was jogging.  So much for "Sport Digital..."  The clip is just a little tab of cheap plastic coming off the back of the unit, no spring clip like a cell phone would have, and it flexes a little bit every time you put it on or take it off of your belt.  After about 1 month of this, it broke completely off and fell on the ground while I was jogging.  I emailed RCA to get them to replace it and they called the belt clip breaking "an act of nature" and said it voided the warranty.  A few weeks after the clip broke, the unit started displaying gibberish instead of the name of the song that was playing and the unit shuts down after about 30 seconds.  RCA won't replace the unit due to the so-called "act of nature" so I am out of luck.  The unit was > $100 at the time and RCA gives you the finger for buying their crappy product.    Bad service + bad product + doesn't stand behind product = don't buy the POS.

[title]:Very Robust Player for the money
[fullText]:My wife has the predacessor (S1010) to this player.  RCA has made significant improvements with this one.  This player is very robust.  The battery compartment is fully protected with the included belt clip.  The edges are made of rubber for superior impact absorption.  My player has been dropped many times and does not have a mark on it.  It has gotten confused from the impact, but a simple power off and then power on corrected the problem.  My wifes predacessor (S1010) is less than a year old and is held together with tape and rubber bands.  This is not something that I anticipate needing to do with the RD2217.  The musicmatch interface software is much more user friendly than that of the S1010.  When you sync an playlist, the playlist actually shows up on the player.  I purchased three of these..one for myself, and two for my daughters (age 6 and 5).  I had to buy some different headphones because the earclips are too large for kids (but are great for adults during exercise).  I have been pleasantly supprised that they have not had much trouble operating the player.  However, I wish that the radio recording function could be disabled.  I gave this four stars because it is a bit heavy.  Although the 50 hours playtime from a AA battery is probably worth it.  I hated the joystick control at first.  Now that I have used the player for a month, I am finaly used to it and now see its advantage.  It is easy to locate the joystick control without looking at the player which allows you to adjust volume or skip songs on the go.  For a splashproof, sport player that is truley robust, you cannot beat this player for under $50.

It's a good player to wear while kicking the soccer ball around or things like that. I've listened to it a few times and sound quality is good. It's a bit bigger than most flash-based MP3 players, but not much so. You can record off FM radio, which my son does a lot.

[title]:good player, minor drawbacks
[fullText]:Just got this for Christmas.  So far it's been great.  Haven't had any major issues with it, even what others have stated. Here are some things that people might not like about it:  you have to use windows media player to add or delete songs from it.  It's not drag and drop like some of the other players I've seen. The software that comes with it(other then the drivers) is like a demo and tends to lock up plus it keeps asking if I want to 'buy' the full version of it everytime I open it. Very annoying, so I just use media player which works just fine. Yes, the plastic clip seems very flimsy, but if you use the arm band, I think it is more then adequate for that.  The buttons, at first, seemed difficult to activate, but as I have been using it that has gotten better.    The earbuds are nice and have good sound. The battery included with the player is a very good long life alkaline.  Over all, I like the player. It was given to me as a gift.  The only thing different I would have like it to have an SD card slot to expand the memory, but then I haven't been able to use up all the memory it currently has!

[title]:decent and cheap -  workout? 
[fullText]:stopping and restarting so that you pick up where you leave off press stop and hold the button until it shuts down. Play will allow you to start back up. I prefered the previous firmware- ie the stuff that's loaded- I ended up installing a new firmware. The previous allowed my player to be recognized only as a flash drive. I liked that because it allowed me to create folders and check the amount of room left easily. The new firmware is better in terms of file order- I believe it loads in the order the files are copied- but I miss the freedom of simply creating a directory and knowing exactly how much room was left. Of course this lead to me accidentily erasing the firmware. But the performance of this player is still decent. The belt clip is long gone, I think I sucessfully used it for three months, and then it broke. It still fits in my pocket and I'm not using it in an athletic situation. It occurs to me that it would be reasobably easy to construct a similar belt clip- perhaps even using some belt clip from another device. I haven't worked out how, but a thin gauge wire might be a good place to start. This player takes a lot of fooling around to figure out and it's not the most intuitive piece but it plays mp3 and wma and that means I happily use it for podcasts and audio books from my local library. It's not perfect but it's not expensive it has a visual display. I've seen something that suggests you can change the background color. I have not achieved that yet.   Keep the firmware (perhaps copying it to your computer as backup).  Don't use it to work out- it's belt clip will fail and that's the only way to use the armband. Unintuitive button use.   Still good playback. Multiple file support. windows media playlists? rugged construction. easy use with conventional or rechargable batteries.

[fullText]:Another in the growing list of very cheaply built almost useless from word go light brittle plastic MP3 players.  The controls on this player are so flimsy you expect to see them on a cheap 3 for one dollar bargain toy.  If you buy this be prepared to treat it extremely gently.  This thing is not designed for anything more exciting than a brisk walk or a low impact workout at the gym.  The thin platic case case is almost passable strength wise but the controls are so cheaply done that if you get 6 months hard use out of them consider yourself blessed.  I guess making one of these things out of a strudy material like "HEVAY METAL" and building controls for it that could withstand a rough Harley ride a back pocket is asking too much in todays cheapest is best bottom line culture.  I for one would gladly pay more for a player this size made out of stronger base material with a strudy set of controls that are this easy to use.  I give it three stars for ease of use.  I had this puppy up figured out and running within 10 minutes of getting it out of the box and powered up.  The headphones are adequate but not awesome an easy enough fix if you need perfect sound.  I'd just like a MP3 player strudy enough to go knocking about in the back woods with this old Wolf when he needs music on the go.  Its a good buy so long as you remember to ALWAYS BE GENTLE WITH IT!  This is a nice player and would have been perfect had they just made the thing able to withstand use in the real world.  As it is this is a nice plastic player for nice sadate sedentary plastic people.  This MP3 player is for those content to watch the world go by set to elevator music placed on this device.  If you are busy out there living life riding hard actually doing things extreme sports etc, hiking, getting into the outdoors this is not the player for you unless you remember to ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS BE GENTLE WITH IT!  Peace be Yours my brothers and sista's. Stay Strong!

[title]:Good Sound-Good Features
[fullText]:This MP3 player is small,it sounds good and has some great features.  It has everything the more expensive brands have.  I called them to check out the warranty and they said, if anything goes wrong within 12 months that they will repalce it for free.  Sounded like a good deal and it works well. I'm happy with the decision I made.

[fullText]:I was very impressed with the service I got from this company. I called in to see if they had an arm band that I could put my MP3 player in. They said that they didn't have one yet but are getting them in a few months. They went the extra mile to email me the search page on amazon that had arm bands and the links for the ones they know fit well. I just got my arm band and it is perfect. Now I can throw my MP3 player in my bag and not worry about it.

[title]:Do you know what kind of WMA files you have?
[fullText]:I purchased the iClick Swurv5 from Amazon for my wife's birthday. I based my choice on the excellent reviews given by other users and its reasonable price.  Basically, I wanted a player that was WMA compatible and would synch easily. My wife doesn't do complicated. She loved the size and style of the Swurv5. The USB connection was straight-forward enough. But when we tried to download songs from Windows Media Player the love affair ended. Of the twenty-two songs in her playlist, only two would download.  I tried contacting iClick and they were very, very helpful. They suggested downloading only a few songs at a time. That didn't work. After going back-and-forth for a few days without progress, I thought I should tell them exactly where I was getting my WMAs--iClick had never thought to ask. Once they found out that I was getting my WMAs directly from MSN Music, they seemed to know what the problem was.  Apparently, there's more than one kind of WMA and MSN Music sometimes uses DRM? in their files. The Swurv5 can't handle DRM.  iClick suggested downloading songs from another service. I wondered why "WMA compatible" didn't include MSN Music--Microsoft's standard from Microsoft's store. Maybe the Swurv5 works great with MP3s but I've never used them.  Short story. My wife loves her new iPod. Her first synch downloaded one-hundred & thirty-eight songs without a hitch.  Two stars for iClick's customer service (they were really great).

[title]:good MP3 for the money
[fullText]:I like this MP3 player very much.  It has a lot of feature and it's easy to figure out all of the functions without even looking at the manual.  Everything is self explanatory. It sounds good enough with the headphones you get with it, but it will sound even better if you use your own set of headphones. The unit is nice and small in size, it holds a lot of songs and the one AAA battery lasts a long time. The only 2 minor negative thing about it are, #1 the FM tuner does not lock in every station on the dial.  #2 the display section (on the front of the unit) is made out of thin glass, which can easily crack.  It would be nice if the Company that builds them, would also supply a protective carrying pouch for it.  I rate it a 4.5 out of 5 stars (very good item).  Thanks MP

[title]:Cheap, Poor Customer Service, Faulty Software
[fullText]:First of all this is made of such cheap plastic it's ridiculous. Second it says on the box it works with Windows 98 but the driver files don't show up on 98 SE. Then their customer service is terrible. I've e-mailed 6 times in the past 3 days and haven't recieved any usefull help. They just ask me over and over what version of Windows I'm running. I had this rush shipped so I would have it for vacation. Well, I leave tomorrow and the darn thing still doesn't work.

[title]:Swurv away!
[fullText]:I've had my Swurv5 now for 2 years and when I first got it, I loved it. Its very small, light weight and the fact that it doubles as a USB drive makes music transfer really easy (just plug in to USB port, computer recognizes it as another hard drive, and drop in your music). The reason I only give it 2 stars is for 3 reasons. 1.) It uses a proprietary cable. I lost it and could not find it anywhere, including on the support web site iclickdigital. 2.) The slider control is now broken on my unit after using it to navigate from folder to folder. I've been pretty light on the touch so to see that it is broken now is very discouraging. 3.) The support for this device is virtually non-existent. There are some chat rooms on iclick's website but no one could tell me where I could get a replacement cable. The bottom line is although out of the box, this is a great player, there are cheaper, more sturdy, and better supported mp3 players out there.

[title]:used work computer to copy to cd to Ipod & lost all my music 
[fullText]:Is iPod, iTunes, iTunes Music Store A Monopoly?    In the basic sense of the word 'monopoly', Apple has one in the iPod ecosystem.   There are multiple definitions as to what constitutes a 'monopoly.' There's Microsoft's Windows. Apple's iPod ecosystem. Merriam-Webster's definition. And the legal definition. Has Apple created a monopoly?   Yes. What goes around, comes around. Apple's iPod ecosystem, which includes the ubiquitous iPod, iTunes on Mac and Windows, and the iTunes Music Store, is truly a monopoly.   Or, nearly a monopoly. Or, could be proven to be a monopoly. Or not. That's how law seems to work these days.   Thomas Slattery sued Apple Computer, claiming the iPod is configured so that it will only play music from iTunes Music Store and not music from other online stores.   In short, Apple is facing a number of federal and state antitrust claims, and a California judge has ruled that the plaintiff (Slattery) in this case has met the qualifications which assert a "tying" claim.   The case may now proceed as a monopolization claim under the federal Sherman Antitrust Act and other claims for violation of California's antitrust and unfair-competition laws.   Microsoft chairman Bill Gates must be smiling. RealNetworks CEO (former Microsoft employee) Rob Glaser probably helped himself to another jelly doughnut.   The judge noted the basic facts: Apple has an 80-percent market share for online music sales, and more than 90-percent of the market for portable hard-drive music players.   According to Merrium-Webster (the only authority who would comment), there's a non-legal definition for 'monopoly`:    Main Entry: mo�nop�o�ly  Function: noun  Inflected Form(s): plural -lies  Etymology: Latin monopolium, from Greek monopOlion, from mon- + pOlein to sell  1 : exclusive ownership through legal privilege, command of supply, or concerted action  2 : exclusive possession or control  3 : a commodity controlled by one party  4 : one that has a monopoly   If Windows is a monopoly at 90-percent of operating systems on PCs, then Apple can have a near-monopoly on portable music players and online music sales with the iPod's ecosystem.   But a monopoly does not illegallity make.   The issue is how Apple wields that monopoly and both the plaintiff and the judge in the California case think Apple may need to loosen the iPod's ecostrings.   It's the whole 'closed system` perspective that seems to continue to haunt Steve Jobs and Apple. Granted, the iPod ecosystem works very well. No one else has bettered the mousetrap.   That's the point. It's a trap. Mostly. Once you buy an iPod, you're pretty much obligated to use iTunes if you want to listen to music on said iPod.   Once you start with iTunes, you're just a click away from the iTunes Music Store, and, if you're an iPod owner, that's pretty much the only store from which you can buy tunes that will play on the iPod.   Except Wal-Mart, or Tower Records, or Sam Goody, or Target, or... you get the idea. There are alternatives, but online it's mostly iTMS or nothing if you're an iPod owner.   For example, you can't buy music on Microsoft's Music Store and play them on your iPod or within iTunes (not easily, not legally). But that's not Apple's fault.   Then again, Microsoft is not the monopolist when it comes to music on PCs. It's an also ran. A runner up to the crumbs left by Apple's stampede.   The lawsuit, and others of similar ilk, have a case, though with many holes. While Microsoft abused their monopolistic position by forcing manufacturers to pay for Windows on every PC shipped, and to bundle software (illegally, it was determined), Apple doesn't really 'force` iPod buyers to use iTMS.   That's the difference, and it's a big difference. The problem is that you can't use other music from other online stores employing DRM (digital rights management) not compatible with iTunes.   Whose fault is that? Apple's? Yes and no.   Posted by Tera Patricks at 9:35 am on Monday, February 6 2006  Category: News * Reader Comments (26) * Email It  Page 1 of 1 pages  Reader comments...  Jeff says:  The remark about Microsoft deliberately modifying Windows to make Quicktime shaky is not completely true. The Quicktime plugin developers did not fully understand what they were doing, and were relying (unknowingly) on an undocumented side-effect. When that changed, they had problems. That was definitely Apples fault, not Microsofts.   The whole "why won't Apple license Fairplay" issue needs to be considered from a real business perspective. Does anyone know for a fact that Apple haven't said to anyone "Sure, you can use it, the one-time cost is $1,000,000,000"? (Long term, thats probably not an unrealistic figure)   The courts cannot mandate a price for a company to sell its IP. That would set a precedent that would bring down the US economy.   You might as well sue Microsoft for not "making Steve Jobs an offer he can't refuse". That'd probably be the responsible thing for Microsoft to do, where responsible == return the greatest profit to MSFT shareholders.   Hell, Apple are already being hauled over the coals for charging 3rd party manufacturers a fee per unit for using iPod-compatible connectors. No-ones suing over that price-gouging, because they can't. Its not illegal to price your product exorbitantly - if you can't afford to make iPod-compatible hardware, thats *your* problem, go make parts for some other mp3 player.   Market forces are supposed to sort this one out. Your new widget appears on the Dell player instead, its an instant hit, people drop the iPod in droves, you get to sleep "on piles of money with many beautiful girls"   The one counter to all of this, that I'm aware of, is the "inter-operability" argument. That Apple should be forced to open its IP up, so that its competitors can inter-operate with it, in the same way that the EU forced Microsoft to show the Samba guys its internals.   But this is not the same situation - the iPod can already play MP3. The only thing it won't do is support "someone elses file format" and thats a function of the business deal between two third parties, the other vendor and the music industry.   If the courts rule that Apple has to change its ways so that Microsoft and Sony can broaden their markets whilst maintaining their current contracts, then they (the courts) have sunk to an amazingly corrupt new low.   Posted by Jeff on Tuesday, February 7 2006 at 11:58 am    ian Johnson says:  Not a fanboy, however apple built a working system and a good interface to deliver. No one is required to use either one. You can still buy CD's and play them on your a CD player. Should cassette- er 8-track manufacturers sue them for making CD's inoperable in an 8-track slot? You probably can't get the new Britny Spears on 8-track, and there's probably a recording of "Pac Man Fever" on cassette that will never make it to CD. It's called out with the old and in with the new. It happens. Don't cry because it just makes it that much harder. Primus came out with a Brown Album on vinyl long after LP's were much in vogue.  This is like the "Coffee is Hot" model with McDonalds. Based on these relatively simple premises:  1. Coffee is hot.  2. If at all possible avoid spilling it on yourself.  Nobody forces coffee to be hot. It's just better that way. Do not commandeer a cup of brew unless you feel you are sufficiently able to navigate the liquid as it cools down, into your mouth.  If you don't know how to load your iPod with songs that you got like your "Pac Man Fever" cassette. Get out your old Walkman. And return the iPod for someone more capable. If you want to buy a PossiblyWillPlay (TM) player and load it with songs you can only find on the iTunes store burn them on CD in audio format, after all you own a copy of the music, then use your Windows Media this or that to import the CD. As long as you bought the music you probably won't be reported to the RIAA for putting your Pat Boone iTunes original collection on your iWinKyoob player.  And to Adam, anyone can put their music on iTunes, even Purple Grandma Deathkill Emo, and apparently keep every penny of the sale from their "Knitting with Satan" EP. See this on Digg   Ok Ok, I'm sort of a fanboy and this is mostly a rant, but more importantly I believe that when you dumb stuff down for the least common denominator, everything starts to suck. -Hey world, someone come up with a cooler idea for music distribution and delivery format and I'll buy it. And in the meantime please keep the whining to a minimum.   Posted by ian Johnson on Tuesday, February 7 2006 at 2:50 pm    iDJ says:  Didn't `WE' choose for iPod and iTunes? Aren't `WE' the millions of people that made the same choice? Didn't `WE' kill the the `others'.  Apple made something that WE love, because of the looks, the feel and it's easy to use too.  That's what WE want and WE made this monopoly!   `WE control iPod'   Posted by iDJ on Tuesday, February 7 2006 at 4:07 pm    Jason says:  "For example, you can?buy music on Microsoft?Music Store and play them on your iPod or within iTunes (not easily, not legally). But that?not Apple?fault."   Actually, that IS Apple's fault. They won't allow iPods to play any DRM'd music but their own through the iTMS. And when anyone has tried to make their alternate legal service work with an iPod (like Real), they got sued by Apple.   The iPod is technically capable of supporting WMA and the associated DRM. The portalplayer platform they're all built on is used in other players that do. Similarly, other players could be made to work with Apple's FairPlay DRM - there's no technical hurdle, it is only that Apple refuses to license it.   Long story short: Apple holds the keys here and it is only their decisions that prevent interoperability (with either players or music stores).   Posted by Jason on Wednesday, February 8 2006 at 10:25 am    Fred Winston says:  Nope, Jason. That's not it. It's still not Apple's fault that Windows media audio, even with DRM, won't play on iTunes. It's the DRM from Microsoft that's at fault. Not Apple. It's not an Apple licensing issue that other DRM'ed music won't play in iTunes. It's the fault of those that have proprietary DRM. The defacto standard for DRM is, of course, FairPlay. From Apple.   Posted by Fred Winston on Wednesday, February 8 2006 at 11:25 am    adam says:  Fred -  it's equally the fault of apple that music bought from iTunes won't play on other non-apple devices.   defacto doesn't mean anything in this context.   Posted by adam on Wednesday, February 8 2006 at 12:10 pm    Kai Cherry says:  Wow. That's all I can say here...after being `hung up on' by a fellow Mac user for picking `the wrong side' in this non-debate. The fact is, it feels good to be on top, some of us have a deep `love' for Apple.   But love is often blind. Apple has an effective monopoly on the Online Digital Music (and soon, probably video) market. This is a fact.   Apple has an *overwhelming* market share of the Hard Disk digital player market...and likely the flash market too. All of this in about 4 years time...from nowhere. Sound familiar?   Alone, these two things are perfectly alright. But the vertical integration in these two markets, and a lack of interoperability, and fairly aggressive tactics to break interoperability are a problem.   And let's not kid ourselves here: *Apple* benefits from this far more that the music rights holders. In the beginning, many, many large artists were not playing along, but the fact is, if you wanna move music online, there really isn't anywhere else to go.   What's really...weird...is that these same points people are using to defend Apple's position are the same one's Microsoft proponents were using. The difference is, by the time anyone stepped in to do anything about it, it was far too late. Everyone lost.   This is an emerging market. You can argue up one side and down the other about inferior competitive products or whatever, but if someone made a music store that sold songs for a nickel less per, worked with iPod/iTunes, and still had DRM...there would be more places to shop.   Or what of the higher quality audio and video people clamor for? Not gonna happen.   As well, if other folks stores could sell players that could play Fairplay DRM music (and lets be honest...this `they can sell in mp3' is a strawman; no Major Content Provider is licensing non-DRM music/video...stay with reality) then there might be room for some new emerging and compelling players out there.   The likely remedy here tho would be that Apple would have to adopt or support another technology; the burden would be on them to interoperate with the rest of the market. And that market uses Helix or WMA DRM.   As it stands, there is a wall there, and there is no way to penetrate it. Think about 5, 10 years from now. What if somehow, Apple was bought, or was no longer "the Apple that we love".   If it were *any other company* would this be "ok"? Seems to me that when it was, it wasn't. All I'm sayin'   Posted by Kai Cherry on Thursday, February 9 2006 at 12:49 am    John says:  Just a thought, but one can turn around and, looking the other way note that tunes bought from Steve only play on (portably) an iPod. That's more of a tie that binds....   Posted by John on Thursday, February 9 2006 at 1:56 am

[title]:!!!!!
[fullText]:to anyone thinking of buying this ipod i would suggest otherwise this is the only ipod i have ever owned so i can not generalize and say that all ipods lack good qualitybut, this does. I had by ipod for no even a year (and took good care of it, not dropping it, carrying it in a protective case) and it died. Just randomly died one day the ipod with the sad face and the exclamation point came up. So thank God i had a warrenty, i got it replaced for free. Everything was great i got it replaced in July 2006, it is now October 2006, and the new one died yesterday. Same thing as the last a "hardware problem". However, now my warrenty is up so in order to get it repaired, i will be charged, and im sure by december it wil have broken again. That is not a chance i am willing to take. As of now i have promised myself to never again purchase a ipod. I am now lookin to purchase either a Philips 30gb mp3 player or a Zen mp3 player, hopefully i will have better luck with either one.  if you purchase this item, good luck =]

[title]:An Outstanding and Very Reliable Music Player
[fullText]:This is my third iPod, and just like the one's before it, it has delivered consistent performance and high quality sound. The iPod is a great looking player and the color screen adds a wonderful dimension for viewing photos and album art. I never have to worry about developing or printing photos anymore; instead I load them onto my iPod to share with friends and family (it's a lot easier than carrying around a photo album).  I've owned this particular player for a over a year now, and have never had any technical problems with it. I used to use it on a Windows computer before making the switch to a Mac, and I experienced seamless integration with both operating systems. It is very, very easy to put music on it with iTunes. The iPod has the most simple, easy to use user interface of any music player on the market, and the click-wheel makes navigating menus, photos, and music effortless.  Another important point is sound quality. I have listened to my iPod through ear-bud headphones (included Apple ear buds), in-ear headphones (Ultimate Ears), over-the-ear studio headphones (Sony DJ Headphones), and desktop speakers (Klipsch 2.1 Multimedia Speakers). No matter what the medium the iPod delivers consistent, quality sound, even at high volumes, with minimal distortion. The entire frequency range is heard through the iPod, which is particularly important to me.  There is a reason the iPod has taken off in the past few years, it consistently delivers great sound and features through an elegant and intuitive interface.

The bottom line is that I previously owned  The 5th generation 30GB video for 18 months. I replaced it with the 4th generation 20GB photo IPOD it sounds better in my car and on my bose digital sound dock. I purchase an MP3 player for sound quality not looks. Hopefully apple will improve the audio computer chip for the current IPOD models. Until then if you want CD quality sound you cannot go wrong with the 4th generation 20GB photo IPOD.

[title]:piece of you know what...
[fullText]:I'd give this latest ipod less than one star if I could.  I've had two in the last week and they've both been pieces of crap.  The first one worked fine for a few days before it just wouldn't turn on one day.  This was about three days into it.  Thankfully Target took it back with no hassles and gave me a replacement.  I figured I'd just gotten a dud.  I mean hey...it happens with even the best brands.  I got it home, loaded it with music and again it played fine for a day or two.  The first time I went to charge it after the initial charge before I ever played it, it froze.  I unplugged it from the charger and it was frozen on the select language screen with the LCD lit up, which won't go off until the battery dies I guess.  Here's hoping Target is as cool about taking this one back.  I defintely won't be getting one of the same kind.  Maybe I'll pay a little more and get one up, or even better my money back.    I think it's because this is the first generation of the affordable color display.  Apple defintely has some bugs to work out of this sucker.  My first ipod still plays great so I think it's just this particular model.  Still, what a disapointment and a hassle.

[fullText]:Well!! Well!! Well guys. What we need is a sleek, perfectly designed, aesthetically pleasing, great sounding player for music. Thats what the latest iPod Photo is. Photos? thats a goodie. Well what I am trying to say is, you cant compare it to any other MP3 players in the market. iPod is in a league of its own.  A device that does one thing perfectly and for long, is what we need. Offcourse we could have a camera on it, a voice recorder may be, AM/FM ow thats a must!!, Cell phone? Make it an organizer....How about a microwave? Yea Rrright... I have played with most of them.....iRiver, Zen, Sony...The all in one paradigm of thought, eventually leaves us with none in one. Being a hardware designer myself, I wouldnt buy an all in one device. Take the iPod in your hand look at it, play it, use it...you will realize that this was created by a buncha cool dudes with passion for design, looks & music. They certainly had problems in their earlier versions. This device shows that they really have made an effort to overcome them to please you. Not merely make it a 'throw in more' competition. I think I see a remarkable betterment in the quality and fedility of the music output. A 20G can hold a lot of songs in its stomach. I wouldnt use it for file storage because you can assemble a 100GB pocket disk that requires no battery, power or recharging for $150. So, I wouldnt go for more than 20GB iPod. No wonder it is so popular.   So, Go for it!! You'll enjoy it.

[title]:This is a great product! 
[fullText]:This is a great product. It's the new and improved iPod 20 GB, same price ($300). Runs up to fifteen hours, which means I can listen to it a few hours a day and charge it every three or four days. Things you'll probably need for this product:  1. A case. Definitely. It could fall or get dirty quite easily.  2. If you like to go for rides on bike, or drive a lot, you'll need a remote control. You can easily and quickly push the buttons to skip or go back to a song.  3. A recorder. If you attend a lecture, or if you're still in school, you can easily record stuff and go back to it. I bought iTalk. Crystal clear, and good. But make sure your earphones are out when you record stuff.  I like playing games in color (the four games: bricks, solitaire, parachute, and music quiz. In music quiz, you try to identify songs that you already have stored on your iPod), and being able to put the album pictures on my iPod. Plus, I can put photos on my iPod and look at them wherever (as long as I have my iPod with me.) If I go on a trip with my camera, and run out of space, I can quickly put the photos on my iPod and then take more pictures. I can take up to 20,000 pictures, so space is not a problem at all (up to 5,000 songs). Plus, I can also put a slideshow on. The scroll wheel is easy to use, although not at first. If I put my iPod in my backpack, there is a "lock" button at the top, so that even when the buttons are pressed, nothing will happen. Volume control is easy.  This product is great; I reccomend it to anyone who wants an iPod.

[title]:Awesome... tears of joy...
[fullText]:The color iPod is the best electronic item I have owned so far... and I've owned a lot. To summarize:  - The Click-wheel is awesome, simple and superb to use - The color screen is great, clear and bright - The sound quality is quite good, though the headphones could handle bass better - iTunes is equally simple to start with, has good enough capabilities. Handling audiobooks is slightly counter-intuitive - The battery life is close to what's reported, though using the backlight and skipping through songs drains it significantly - One capability I seriosly miss in the iPod is song search capability. That would be the icing on the cake.  So far, soooo good. Can't have enough!

[title]:Buy the protection plan!
[fullText]:Make sure you figure the cost of the protection plan when determining whether the iPod is a good deal or not.  Mine failed two weeks after the warranty expired.  My options?  Send them the failed iPod and $255 + tax and they send me a used or refurbished model with a 90 day warranty.  Basically they just want you to buy a new one.  Had I known that up front, I would have passed or at least made sure I bought the protection plan.  I got exactly 1 year out of mine and now it would cost me more to have it serviced than to buy a new one, so it is completely worthless.

[title]:iPod Nano, first generation
[fullText]:I have a shuffle and got an Nano for my children.  This product was refurbished and an older generation but this is what I wanted as my children are younger.  I didn't want to spend too much money on something that would likely be dropped dozens of times or even lost.  Love the iPod, easy to use, easy to sync.  Wish I had gotten one capable of playing videos but won't send it back because of that.  Product was shipped on time and arrived in stated condition.  No complaints.
