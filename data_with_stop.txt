screen however die for has same qvga resolution new ipod th gen more colors thing beggin video saw gigabeat x sadly isnt released us rather japan costs website shorter doesnt feature protrusion f quite weird quickly installed gigabeat room found very buggy froze multiple times has few bugs i explain later pros cons rolled one the screen amazing say however sunshines glare makes nearly impossible read anything fonts usually white download qvga wallpapers itll sometimes unreadable spots screen themes cool making truly stand against ipod no video gah thing crying video due qvga display the same ipod th gen fairly large size the xs better though possible through firmware upgrade toshibas forgotten as already released firmware japan three gigabeats sucueed f p p new japanonly
